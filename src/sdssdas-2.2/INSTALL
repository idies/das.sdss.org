Installing the SDSS DAS 2 CGI interface
=======================================

The software package contains code for the CGI executables associated
with the SDSS DAS version 2, except for the drC source and executable,
which can be found in a separate package, sdssdrc. This package also
contains web pages closely tied to the scripts (those used to submit
requests handled by the executables).

The CGI executables should compile using the standard GNU autoconf
configure invocations. You will want to use the --prefix option to set
the location where the executables and associated web pages get
installed, and the --sysconfdir to the location in which you want to
store the configuration file. For example:

bash$ ./configure --prefix=/srv/das --sysconfdir=/usr/local/etc

will generate makefiles with "install" targets that put CGI
executables in /srv/das/www/cgi-bin, html pages is /srv/das/www/html,
and css files in /srv/das/www/css. The executables made using these
makefiles will read their configuration from
/usr/local/etc/sdssdas.conf.

Once you have run the configure script, "make" the package:

bash$ make

To copy the executables, web pages, and css files where you requested,
run make again:

bash$ make install

To actually have a running DAS, you will need to obtain a local copy
of the data content of the DAS, designate a scratch area, and
configure both you web server and sdssdas itself.
