<TITLE>Photometric Calibration and the Monitor Telescope</TITLE><H1><A NAME="photcal">Photometric Calibration and the Monitor Telescope</A></H1><P>

<H2>Motivation for High Precision</H2><P>

The scientific returns of the imaging survey depend to a large

extent on the accuracy of its photometric calibration.  A 10-Terabyte
multiband data set that covers   pi   steradians of the sky, in which there
are  10<sup>8</sup> sources bright enough to be well measured, can be used to
investigate exceedingly subtle phenomena, provided the photometry is
adequate.  The fundamental issue of the isotropy of the galaxy
distribution over large angles depends in an essential way on how well
the photometric zero point has been transferred across the sky, and on
the proper evaluation of Galactic absorption.  For example, Burstein and
Heiles (1978, 1982) estimate the errors in their reddening maps to be at the
level of
  delta  E(B-V)=0.03 ; this variation alone would result in an error in the
galaxy surface density of about 14%.
<P>

<H2>The Required Photometric Precision</H2><P>

The photometric accuracy is driven

by three science requirements:
<P>

1. QSO Photometry: Experience with using existing color data to separate stars

and QSOs is that systematic photometric errors in the colors
should be no larger than about 5%.
<P>

2.  Large-scale structure studies: Imagine

scanning a single strip for the entire night(2.5&deg; by 120&deg;). The
most demanding analysis that one can do is to divide the strip into two
halves and measure the difference in galaxy counts between the two.  For
the spectroscopic sample (magnitude limit about 18 in  r' ),
the rms scatter in
this difference due to the known large scale
clustering is expected to be at least 8%. The rms systematic photometric
error should therefore
be no larger than half of this, or 4% in galaxy counts; using
a value of 0.5 for  d log  N/dm , this corresponds to a 3% rms error in
photometry in the band used to select the galaxies.  If we repeat
the exercise for ALL galaxies identified by the imaging survey (which reaches
much fainter than  20<sup>m</sup> ), the fluctuations due to
clustering will be much weaker,
perhaps less than 1%.  Thus, we could make use of data with systematic
errors smaller than 0.5% rms.
<P>

3. Interstellar reddening:

The ultimate limit in analyzing galaxy counts is set by fluctuations
in the interstellar reddening and extinction.  The primary technique
used to find the extinction is to measure the shifts in color of some
class of objects and to use standard conversions from selective to
total extinction.  From published Gunn-Thuan photometry
(Thuan and Gunn 1976; Schneider, Gunn and Hoessel 1983), we find that
 A<sub>r</sub> = 2.1 E<sub>g-r</sub> , so that the colors must be measured twice as
accurately as the desired accuracy of the extinction itself.  Calibration
of the Galactic extinction thus requires that color errors be less than
about 1.5% rms for the analysis of the spectroscopic sample and
0.25% for the full imaging sample.
<P>

Regardless of the science one is trying to do, the limiting accuracy to which

reddening and extinction can be measured is ultimately set by irreducible
systematic errors in the technique used to measure the reddening.  If we
did nothing beyond using the Burstein-Heiles extinction map we would
not be able to extract the full amount of information available in the
imaging survey.  We expect to investigate several techniques to
improve on the existing reddening maps but the limiting accuracy is
not knowable in advance.  For example,
one promising technique is to measure the  g' - r'  color distribution
of stars at around magnitude 18; the halo stars form a strongly peaked
distribution whose width
is about 0.3 magnitudes and whose centroid can be measured to
perhaps 0.03 magnitudes.  The position of the peak will depend on both
reddening and population variations (metallicity and age).  If the
latter effects can be calibrated, we will have a powerful technique
for measuring the reddening.  To do so with sufficient accuracy
requires that the stellar colors should have systematic photometric
errors of order 0.015 magnitudes.
<P>

After considering the above factors, we have set the requirements for

the photometric calibration accuracy of the imaging survey to be
no worse than 2% rms in magnitudes and colors averaged over degree sized
areas, with a goal to achieve twice that accuracy.
<P>

<H3>Limits to Achieving Photometric Precision</H3><P>

Our requirement of 2% rms error ought to be easily achievable based

on our and others experience with carrying out precision photometry.
The limits to photometric accuracy are usually set by the accumulation of
several small sources of error, each of comparable magnitude.
Some of these are:
<P>

<OL>
<LI>Atmospheric extinction:  Accurate calibration will require the frequent
observation of standard stars.  Extinction variations on the order of a few
percent can occur on hour time scales.  The stability of the extinction at
APO is not yet known.

<LI>There is an inherent irreproducibility for broadband flux measurements
of sources with unknown spectral energy distributions  f<sub>nu</sub>   obtained
at different airmass.  This arises because the quantity  T<sub>nu</sub>
f<SUB>nu</sub> A<sub>nu</sub> will integrate to different values, where
T<sub>nu</sub>(t)  is the instrumental sensitivity and A<sub>nu</sub>(t,X) 
is the atmospheric transmission at time  t  and airmass  X .  In practice
this problem is minimized by using the colors themselves to deduce the general
form of f<sub>nu</sub>, iteratively if necessary, but there will still be a
residual. The residual will be larger for galaxy photometry than for stellar
photometry because of the greater variety of  f<sub>nu</sub> for redshifted
galaxies.  Synthetic models of star and galaxy spectra can be computed
and folded through the SDSS filters to obtain at least a handle on the
magnitude of this residual.

<LI>Instrumental calibration errors associated with
flatfielding problems, etc.
</OL>
<P>

<H2>The Monitor Telescope</H2><P>

We will establish the

primary photometric calibration for the survey
by using a small robotic telescope
at the 2.5-m survey telescope site. This instrument will observe
continuously and automatically a set of photometric standards to
calibrate the main survey.
<P>

The primary standard stars for the SDSS system are

a grid of 20-30 bright, isolated stars
in each of the northern and southern skies.
All are photometric standards in current use, and
a few have absolute calibrations.  The energy distributions of
these standard stars have been transferred to the SDSS filter
system (Fukugita et al. 1996).
A subset of the primary standards will be observed nightly by the
Monitor Telescope,
efficiently placing the survey telescope imaging data onto an
absolute photometric system.
<P>

The telescope itself is a 0.61 m automatic telescope purchased commercially

from the Autoscope Corporation.
It is an f/10 Ritchey-Chr&eacute;tien design with a Gascoigne corrector and
field flattener to provide  0.6"  images over a  40'  diameter field of view.
The telescope control system was supplied by Autoscope but it
is being reworked for the survey. The data acquisition system hardware is
provided by Fermilab.
The camera is a slightly modified version of the spectroscopic camera
electronics.  The detector is a thinned Tektronix  2048 x 2048  CCD
with  0.8"  pixels and a  27'  square field of view.
The telescope and its dome will be capable of autonomous
operation from a cold start for extended periods of time.
The telescope and all instrumentation 
are installed at the site and have been undergoing commissioning
tests for several months.  Monitor telescope images of a standard star field
are shown in Figure <A HREF="../photcal/photcal.htm#mtplot">5.1</A>.

filters.  The sixth panel is intentionally left blank.
<HR>
<P>

The Monitor Telescope will be used for several months in advance of the

main Survey to observe extensively the primary standard star network
and define the SDSS photometric system.  During the survey, it will operate
in parallel with the 2.5 m telescope, observing both primary standard stars
and a set of secondary transfer fields that will be be scanned by the
2.5 m telescope.  These data can be analyzed to
provide the three necessary calibration coefficients needed to
place the survey imaging data onto the SDSS photometric system.
<P>

The first coefficient is the atmospheric extinction.

A minimum of 6 fundamental standard stars at a variety of airmasses
will be observed
each hour during the night in order to determine the extinction
coefficients on an hourly basis.
<P>

The second coefficient is the photometric zeropoint for each 2.5 m photometric

CCD.  The Monitor Telescope will observe a grid of transfer star
fields distributed
throughout the SDSS survey area. We have selected a grid of 2392 fields,
chosen to maximize the distance away from bright stars (see Figure
<A HREF="../strategy/strategy.htm#mapProjectionFig">1.2</A>).
The Monitor Telescope observations calibrate the transfer
fields so that when the main survey scans across them, we can use the known
magnitudes in the fields to determine the zeropoints of the main
survey photometry.
Each transfer field must contain
about 10 stars that do not saturate
the SDSS camera but are measured with better than
  1%  accuracy rms by the Monitor
Telescope.
The zeropoints of the main survey may change with time
because the field rotates with respect to the telescope pupil,
so we will provide transfer
fields for each scanline hourly.
Each of the six scanlines will need its own
transfer field.
The Monitor Telescope will observe the transfer star field as
nearly simultaneously with the main survey scan as feasible.
<P>

Last, there may be mismatches of the

system efficiency as a function  of wavelength
between the main telescope and the Monitor Telescope because a
single thinned Tektronix chip is used to calibrate all five bands
(although the MT optics are coated to minimize this problem).
This introduces
color terms into the solutions.
Experience has shown that such color terms change slowly with time
(we will measure them once a week). The Monitor Telescope
will observe secondary standard star patches known to
contain a good distribution of star colors.
Then, when convenient (for example, when there is some moonlight),
all the CCDs in the
SDSS camera will scan one of the color patches.
<P>

Second order coefficients (which account for the slight dependence of the

atmospheric extinction on spectral energy distribution of a star or galaxy)
will be included in the photometric solutions as well.  We will try to
measure them as well, although they are small enough that they can
likely be computed in advance with sufficient accuracy.
<P>

A quick photometric solution will be computed in real time during the night.

and provided to the observers
conducting the main survey. This will allow them
to monitor the quality of the night.
<P>

There are several special cases  which need to be discussed.

The  u'  band observations require special treatment as
the stars that are bright enough to serve as standards in  u' 
are saturated in the  g'r'i'  bands. We address this by allowing
the random error to be higher in the  u'  band
( 2%  instead of  1% ; this allows us to use fainter stars
as standards) and by doubling the Monitor Telescope integration time
on the the  u'  standards.
<P>

A second special case is the rapid variability in the near
infrared sky, especially the water absorption bands. This will
affect our ability to calibrate the  i'  and  z'  bands properly.
We may choose
to monitor the infrared sky on a nightly basis with
two filters centered on the A band and an infrared
H<sub>2</sub>O band.  Observations through these filters will
allow us to apply color terms due to the changing atmosphere to
the photometric solution.
<P>

A third special case is the spectrophotometric calibration of the
spectroscopic data.  This
will be accomplished by the use of 10 narrow-band filters, 8 spanning the
wavelength range of the spectrograph, the other two to measure the
A band and a suitable infrared water band, probably the same filters
described in the last paragraph. The primary standard stars with absolute
photometric calibrations
will be observed with this filter set, and the system transferred
to a set of secondary spectrophotometric standard stars, approximately
three per spectroscopic
field. These secondary stars in turn will be observed by
the main survey spectrograph
to provide the system response. The calibration of the secondary stars
is an onerous task, but probably can be
short-circuited.  There are some tens of F subdwarfs per
spectroscopic field which are sufficiently bright that high-quality
spectra can be obtained. These stars are
spectrophotometrically very similar, and the 5-color
photometric data  may be enough to determine the
energy distribution to sufficient accuracy for
flux calibration.  We then need only to obtain 10 band photometry
of a grid of such subdwarfs, which is a much smaller number than the
total number of secondary spectroscopic standards.
<P>

<H3>The Rate of Operation</H3><P>

The Monitor Telescope must be able to observe 6 bright standard stars and
6 SDSS transfer star fields per hour in order to keep up with the
imaging survey and provide enough stars to calibrate the atmospheric
extinction and monitor the atmospheric transmission quality.
Because the field of view of the monitor telescope is large,
it is possible to observe transfer fields for two adjacent scanlines of
the SDSS with one
Monitor Telescope field, doubling the number of stars per scanline
and cutting the number of Monitor Telescope fields in half.
The monitor camera CCD will have 2 corner readouts
with digitization times of 15   &micro;sec per pixel.
The time budget is then as follows:
<P>

(1) Integration time of bright standard star field plus 5 sec

for filter positioning and overhead - 15 sec/frame;
6 fields  x  5 filters; 7.5 minutes total per hour.
<P>

(2) Readout of bright standard star field - (central 1024 <sup>2</sup>

only) - 32 sec/frame; 6 fields  x  5 filters; 16 min total per hour.
<P>

(3) Integration time of transfer fields plus 5 sec for filter positioning

and miscellaneous overhead - 60 sec per frame ( g'r'i'z' ), 115 sec per frame
( u' ); 3 fields  x  5 filters; 17.8 min total per hour.
<P>

(4) Readout of transfer fields - 32 sec/frame;  3 fields  x 

5 filters; 8.0 min total per hour.
<P>

(5) Slew time: 1 minute/field;

9 fields; 9 minutes total per hour.
<P>

Total: 58 minutes per hour.  This leaves us little margin

for unexpected difficulties, but some of the timings above are pessimistic
and all are well known with the exception of  u'  band exposure times.
<P>

<H3>IR Sky Monitor and Weather Station</H3><P>

There will be two adjunct systems to the Monitor Telescope.

Both provide data  on the quality
of the night to the survey observers.
The first is an IR all-sky scanner.  This 10 &micro; linear array camera
complements the Monitor Telescope by
providing continuous all-sky images that are very effective at detecting clouds.
The scanner has been built, tested,
and is now in routine use at the 3.5 m telescope.  It performs extremely
well.  The second system is a small weather station that monitors
temperature, wind, pressure, and humidity.
We will use it in making qualitative assessments of the SDSS
data quality (e.g., does bad seeing correlate with wind direction,
wind speed, rapid temperature variations, etc.).
