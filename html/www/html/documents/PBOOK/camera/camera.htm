<TITLE>The Photometric Camera and the CCDs</TITLE><H1><A NAME="camera">The Photometric Camera and the CCDs</A></H1><P>

<H2>The Photometric System</H2><P>

The photometric camera for the SDSS consists 
of two TDI scanning CCD arrays, one,
using 30 Tektronix/SITe  2048 x 2048  CCDs in a 5 by 6 array for
five-color photometry, and the other using 24  2048 x 400  chips
for astrometry and focus monitoring.  We here discuss these arrays, the
filter system, the scheme for focusing the
telescope during an imaging scan, and the CCDs and associated
electronics for the camera and the spectrograph. 
<P>

There are several important considerations in selecting the filter system.

First, one wants the largest color
baseline possible.  It is desirable but not necessary to use filters for
which there already exist a large amount of data.  For example, the
Thuan-Gunn (1976), (see also Schneider et al.  1983) 
 uvgriz  system, which has been used for much of the
work at Palomar on distant clusters, avoids the 5577&Aring; night
sky line, and the  i  band cuts off in the near-infrared 
just shortward of the major
OH bands.  The  g  and  r  filters more-or-less match the  J  and  F 
bands of the new Palomar Sky Survey.  The  uvgriz 
filters provide coverage of the total wavelength
interval and are almost uniformly spaced in   log  lambda  .  They are,
however, fairly narrow, and all except  u 
could be usefully widened for a
system like ours in which efficiency is of paramount importance.  We
have designed a filter system similar to  ugriz  which should transform
to and from it with little difficulty, in which the  g ,  r  and  i  filters
are as wide as practicable consistent with keeping the overlap small. 
If we wish the  u  band to be a "good" one which is almost entirely
contained between the Balmer jump and the atmospheric cutoff (we can
clearly not do anything about that end), it cannot be significantly
wider than Thuan-Gunn  u .  We
call the new system  u'   g'   r'   i'   z' .
The response curves and sensitivity data with the coatings
and CCDs we will use are shown in  Figure <A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#reponseCurveFig">4.1</A>.

The SDSS system response curves. The responses are shown without atmospheric
extinction (upper curves) and as modified by the extinction at 1.2
airmasses (lower curves). The curves represent expected total quantum
efficiencies of the camera plus telescope on the sky.<HR>
<P>

The characteristics, are, in brief:  u' , a band with 3540&Aring;

effective wavelength, 570&Aring; full width at half-maximum, and 60% peak
transmission (such a filter can be made with available glasses; it has a
small redleak problem which can be solved with suitable coatings);  g' ,
a very wide blue-green band centered on 4770&Aring; (full width at
half-maximum 1370&Aring;);  r' , a red band of the same width centered at
6230&Aring;;  i' , a far-red band centered at 7630&Aring; with a width of
1530&Aring;, and  z' , a near-infrared band centered at 9130&Aring;
with a width of 950&Aring;.
These bands share the advantages of the  uvgriz  system of avoiding
the 5577&Aring; [OI] line, and the  i'  band cutting
off before the catastrophic OH brightening and water absorption set in
just longward of 9000&Aring;.  All the filters except  u'  are easy to make and 
have very high central transmission; building the  u'  filters proved to
be difficult, but the results are quite satisfactory.
<P>

The filters are all made with one or more Schott colored glass elements

in combination with a single-surface interference film which serves
different purposes in different filters.  The  u'  filter is made of 1 mm
of UG11 and 1 mm of BG38 with an interference layer which both acts
as an antireflection coating in the filter passband and an efficient red
blocker in a region a few hundred &Aring; wide around 7000 &Aring;; the
glass filters have sufficient red rejection outside this region, but
the uncoated filter has a peak transmission of about two percent there.
The coated filter has a maximum transmission of about  10<sup>-4</sup>  outside
the primary band.
The  g'  filter is made of 2
mm of GG400 and 3 mm of BG38, with a film which acts as a short-pass
element cutting on at 5500 &Aring;; the BG38 blocks the red efficiently
out to the silicon limit.  The three longer filters consist of a
single colored long-pass element and for the two shorter ones a
short-pass interference film, the  r'  4 mm RG550 and short-pass cutoff at
7000 &Aring;, the  i'  4 mm RG695 and short-pass cutoff at 8500 &Aring;, and
the  z'  4 mm of RG830 open to the red. Each filter is brought to 5 mm
physical apex thickness by means of an (quartz for  u' , BK7 for the rest)
individual field flattener cemented
to it; this element is necessitated by the fact that the chips are not
flat, but are convex to the incoming light by about 230 microns measured
center to corner. The final filters were all constructed and coated by 
Asahi Spectro-Optical
in Tokyo; the characteristics and uniformity are superb.
<P>

The filter assemblies in turn are cemented to the flat rear face of the

final corrector element.  The front face of the corrector has been
anti-reflection coated in horizontal stripes tailored for each filter
passband, resulting in about 0.2% reflectivity over each band. 
The coating was done by QSP in Los Angeles.  Since the filters are
cemented assemblies and are themselves cemented to the corrector, there
are only two optical surfaces near the CCD, and one of those has very
low reflectivity. The other is the filter coating itself, which has low
reflectivity in the passband but unfortunately has intrinsically high
reflectivity near the long-wave cutoff over a very small wavelength
region.  It is these "crossover" regions which contribute most of
the ghost energy. We have calculated ghost images for the camera, and
they will not present a serious difficulty for the photometric reductions. 
<P>

With our arrangement of

CCDs operating in TDI mode at sidereal rate, we obtain
near-simultaneous color data in the five bands; the time lapse from
the  r'  data, the first received, to the  g' , the last, is about
five minutes.
<P>

It is worth noting that this color set is

<I>not</I> any standard one, but this survey will produce two orders of
magnitude more photometry than currently exists, and to adopt a system
not optimized for the survey seemed folly.  The filter set is in any case
a good one for CCDs and has some quite nice astrophysical properties; we
hope that it will quickly <I>become</I> a standard system. Toward
that end we are in the process of producing as complete an astrophysical
characterization of it (metallicity, gravity, temperature, galaxy type
and redshift dependences) as we can; we clearly badly need these data
ourselves. We will attempt to ensure that workers wanting sets of filters
for this system will have reasonable avenues open to obtaining them.
<P>

With these filters, the CCDs with which they will be used, and with the

SDSS telescope scanning at sidereal rate, the limiting magnitudes at the
detection limit, S/N 5:1, will be about  u'=22.3 ,  g'=23.3 ,  r'=23.1 ,
 i'= 22.5  and  z' = 20.8 .  These limiting magnitudes are for stars,
note, and those for galaxies are typically between half a magnitude and
a magnitude brighter at the same signal to noise ratio.  A signal to
noise ratio of 50:1 (and hence photometry at the 2% level) is reached
for stars at 19.3, 20.6, 20.4, 19.8 and 18.3 in the five bands.  Note
that these are magnitudes on the AB system, referred to a spectrum with
constant  f<sub>nu</sub>   (not an A0V star), and represent the fluxes a flat
spectrum source with a given  V  magnitude would have near the effective
wavelengths of the filters.  It is these zero points we intend to adopt. 
These sensitivity calculations assume 1 arcsecond FWHM seeing (with a
probably somewhat pessimistic non-gaussian PSF) and a sky with a  V 
surface brightness of 21.7 mag/arcsecond&sup2;  (typical of the Apache
Point site) with average extinction
at the zenith.  A darker site helps, with roughly half a magnitude gain
in limit per magnitude improvement in the sky (at these faint levels
shot noise in the sky is the dominant noise source).

CCDs and their associated dewars and kinematic supports.<HR>
<P>

Although the  u'  band is obviously useful, 

the other bandpasses provide a maximum wavelength ratio of 2.4, and
adding  u'  only increases the baseline to 3.0.  Is there much advantage
to using  u'  versus a slightly longer wavelength band such as Johnson
 B  or Thuan-Gunn  v ? The answer is resoundingly yes, on three
accounts.  First, the  u' -band is much more sensitive to population and
metallicity effects than any of the longer wavelength bands.  For
example, for normal spiral galaxies,  U-B  changes 1.5 times as fast as
 B-V .  In elliptical galaxies, color gradients (which most likely
reflect metallicity variations) are 3 times as big in  U-B  as in  B-V ;
one must reach from  B  
to the  K -band to achieve comparable sensitivity.  The
 u' -band lies shortward of the H and K break in late-type galaxy
spectra and provides the best indicator of the presence of recent
star-formation activity.  Second, at high redshift, galaxies are usually
observed in the more accessible and sensitive longer wavelength bands,
which register light that, in the galaxy rest frame, is emitted in the
ultraviolet.  The  u' -band is shifted to  g'  at  z = 0.34 ,  r'  at  z
= 0.83 , and  i'  at  z = 1.3 .  Third, the ultraviolet is essential in
any color-based QSO survey to separate low-redshift ( z&lt;2 ) QSOs from 
stars, particularly low-metallicity halo stars, and, incidentally, 
to separate low-metallicity 
halo stars from high-metallicity stars. 
<P>

We had originally

planned to devote two of the five chips in a given column to the 
 u'  band for the sake of
efficiency, but new UV anti-reflection coatings and an accompanying
surface treatment developed by Tektronix/SITe for
the  u'  chips, together with a
higher-than-expected efficiency of the  u'  filter,
have led us to go with the current set of 
five independent bands, including the new  z'  filter.
The new band is especially useful in the detection
of very high-redshift quasars and extremely red stars, and, perhaps most
importantly, distinguishing them from each other.
<P>

<H2>The Photometric Array-Layout and Performance</H2><P>

The photometric camera is designed to use thirty 2048&sup2;  sensors in
a six-wide by five-high array, so arranged that two transit swaths
(strips) cover completely a stripe 2.53&deg; wide in the five independent
filters, with some overlap (about 1 arcminute) between sensors. About
8.3% of the area of a given stripe is imaged twice.  The focal
plane of the camera array is illustrated in Figure <A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#cameraAssemblyFig">4.2</A>.
Also shown there are
the 22 smaller (2048 x 400) chips used to provide astrometric 
calibration, and the two 2048 x 400 focus monitors.
The scanning is top-to-bottom in Figure <A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#cameraAssemblyFig">4.2</A>,
along the five closely-spaced CCD columns, and it is handy in discussing the
camera to think about the geometry in this orientation. (Thus "top" of the
camera will always refer to the leading edge.)

The expected photometric performance of the camera is outlined in Table

<A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#cameraPerformTab">4.1</A>,
which presents the assumed filter parameters, derived from the
curves in Figure <A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#reponseCurveFig">4.1</A>.
The quantity  q<sub>t</sub>  is the peak system quantum efficiency in
the system, and  q<sub>t</sub>dl/l  is the integral of the system efficiency times
 d( ln   lambda ) ; it is this quantity which relates the monochromatic
flux averaged over the filter passband to the resulting signal:
<P>
<CENTER>N<sub>el</sub> = 1.96x10<sup>11</sup>t(q<sub>t</sub>dl/l)10<sup>-0.4AB<sub>nu</sub> </sup>.</CENTER>
<P>
The counts and signal-to-noise ratios for
an assumed sky with a  V  brightness of 21.7 mag per square arcsecond
(about 1.2 airmasses for the typical sky brightness at Apache Point) and
a Palomar spectrum (Turnrose, 1974) are given in Table <A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#cameraPerformTab">4.1</A>c
for stellar objects with 1 arcsecond FWHM images with a
reasonably realistic seeing-dominated PSF (see Chapter <A HREF="../simul/simul.htm#simul">9</A>). 
The assumed exposure time is 55 seconds, which corresponds to a TDI
scanning rate near sidereal; this rate is near optimal from a variety of
considerations.  The assumed full well is  3x 10<sup>5</sup> electrons and
the noise is a bit worse than typical at 7 e<sup>-</sup>.  The assumed CCD quantum
efficiencies are averages of the measured ones for the chips that will
actually be in the camera; the dispersion is quite small. Typical
galaxy images reach a given S/N half a magnitude to a magnitude brighter
at the faint end, depending on their surface brightness. 
<P>

<H2>Mechanical Design of the Photometric Array</H2><P>

Since the telescope has been designed carefully to accommodate the CCDs,

the camera design is simply a matter of housing the chips
stably, controlling their temperature, and tending to their various electronic
needs.  The only complication in this is brought about by the scale of
the project and the attendant necessity of putting a lot of stuff,
particularly circuitry, into a relatively small space. The only moving
parts on the camera are associated with a simple set of pneumatically
actuated shutters
which cover each dewar and are intended mostly to protect the CCDs from
saturation during the day and when the enclosure lights are on, though
the shutter can also be used to take non-critically timed `snapshot' exposures.
The camera will be installed and removed from the telescope with a special
cart/handling fixture which also carries the "saddle" upon which are
mounted a pair of 10-liter liquid nitrogen dewars and the power supplies
for the camera. The camera is mounted to the telescope with a trefoil
kinematic mount which is also shared with the plug-plate cartridges. The
camera side of this
mount is carried by a steel ring girder which provides the basic structure
for the camera and a stable attachment point for the cell for the final
corrector, which is the optical substrate upon which the sensors and
filters are mounted, as will be described in greater detail below.
<P>

The CCDs for the photometric array will be housed in 6 long thin dewars

(Figures <A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#cameraAssemblyFig">4.2</A> and <A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#photoDewarBenchFig">4.3</A>)
machined from aluminum blocks, each containing
the 5 chips in one column.  The CCDs are quiet enough to be run at -80&deg;C,
and will be kept at that temperature by an auto-fill
liquid-nitrogen system which will be described in the next section.  The
optical system is fast enough and the focal plane big enough that
mounting the chips and maintaining dimensional stability is potentially
a very difficult problem.  We seek to perform astrometry at the
30-milliarcsecond-per-coordinate level, 
which corresponds to 2 microns in a focal plane
600 mm in diameter.  We have elected to solve this problem in a rather
unusual but, we think, very satisfactory manner.  The final corrector in
the optical system is a quite thick piece of fused quartz with a flat
rear face, 45 mm thick in the center and some 8 mm thicker at the rim,
and we use this element as the mechanical substrate to which all
the CCDs are registered and all the dewars attached.  The corrector is
thus both a mounting substrate and window for the camera dewars.  Quartz
is strong, reasonably stiff, 
has excellent dimensional stability and very small thermal
expansion coefficient, and the small mechanical deflections associated
with loading it with the camera have completely negligible impact on its
optical performance.  Figure <A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#cameraAssemblyFig">4.2</A> shows the front view
of the whole
assembly as it would look with the shutters removed, through the final
corrector.  Figure <A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#faceplateFig">4.4</A> shows the assembled corrector plate,
mounted in its support, with the filters and the dewar mounting rails.

The face plate (photometric corrector) of the photometric camera. The plate has
been mounted in its steel cell.  The filters from top

filters are above and below the photometric array, though what is seen
is the neutral density filters associated with those. The quartz kinematic
mounts for the photometrics and invar ones for the astrometrics can be seen,
as can the invar rails for mounting the dewar bodies and the screw anchors
in the quartz for both. The boxes occupying
the spaces the dewars normally reside in 
are just protective covers for handling.<HR>
<P>

The CCDs in the column are mounted 65 mm center-to center, which leaves

1.5 mm gaps between the 63 mm square Kovar packages in which the
devices are mounted.  There is a similar gap between the edges of the
packages and the sidewalls of the dewars.  The CCDs are individually
cemented to the ball element of an invar-36 ball-and-socket mount whose
center of curvature is at the surface of the chip
(Figures <A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#photoDewarBenchFig">4.3</A>, <A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#photoOpticBenchFig">4.5</A>, and 
<A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#photoDewarFig">4.7</A>). These mounts provide tilt adjustment via a set
of three push-push screws on each.
These assemblies are in turn mounted on a `T'-shaped invar-36 optical bench
(Figure <A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#photoOpticBenchFig">4.5</A>)
in a manner which allows small independent rotation of the chips and
shimming for piston. The optical benches, one
per CCD column, are mounted to the quartz corrector by a kinematic mount
which consists of a quartz column bonded and screwed to the corrector,
and a set of four ball-and-double-rod pads. On one end, the arrangement
consists of two balls on sets of parallel ways, one parallel to the
long axis of the bench and the other perpendicular, which locates that
end in both dimensions to within small rotations. On the other, one
ball rests in a set of parallel ways parallel to the bench, which 
fixes the rotation but is free to move along the bench, and the other
in sets of <I>mutually perpendicular</I> ways, which is completely free
to <I>slide</I> in the plane. The bench is sufficiently flexible in
torsion that the four vertical constraints can be mated independently
with quite reasonable dimensional tolerances and forces (50N) on the
balls, and in fact <I>needs</I> the four-point support for torsional
stability. The  3/16"  balls are made of titanium, which is tough, combines
reasonably good Young's modulus and reasonably low thermal conductivity, and
the  3/32"  rods of hard stainless steel. The conductive losses for each
ball joint are about 0.5 watt, with the 100&deg;C temperature drop shared 
roughly equally between the ball joint and the quartz pillar. We were
quite amazed that the measured conductivity of the ball-rod joint was
within about twenty percent of the calculated value for a wide variety of
materials we tried; the scheme appears to work very well.
The one
disadvantage we know about for this scheme is that the stresses on the
balls and rods are very high owing to the tiny contact area. There is
no danger of failure at the static stress levels, but dynamic loading 
associated with handling could easily permanently deform either member.
To avoid this, each dewar uses a set of four electroformed nickel bellows
which are pressurized at 40 PSI to bring the optical benches into contact
with the kinematic mounts for observing. When the camera is being mounted
or otherwise moved, this pressure is relieved and springs retract the
optical benches about 1 mm and latch them away from the kinematic mounts.
<P>

The optical benches (Figure <A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#photoOpticBenchFig">4.5</A>)

are quite stiff in bending.  Loaded with their own
mass and that of the CCDs with their ball-and-socket mounts their mass is
about 2.7 kg and deflect about 1.3 &micro;   in the focus direction and
1.0 &micro; in the focal plane under worst-case gravity loading.  The
kinematic mounts deflect a similar amount.  Since the loading changes
are very slow, the contribution to the astrometric error from these
deflections should be negligible.  The overall deflection of the
corrector in the focus direction (which is the <I>only</I> direction there
are appreciable deflections) is about 2 microns neglecting the
stiffening by the dewar bodies.  At worst focus changes induce centroid
motion a factor of 20 smaller, so there is no appreciable error from
this source. Since the dewars in this design are simply vacuum enclosures
and, except for the preload bellows pushrods, 
do not even contact the optical benches,
the load paths are very
direct from the kinematic mounts to the telescope structure. The only
tricky part of the design is the fact that there was a fair amount of
(simple) machining to do on the quartz corrector.
There are about 100 holes for screw
anchors for the kinematic columns and the dewar mounting rails. The screw
anchors consist of knurled brass inserts epoxied into these holes. The 
whole process went without mishap, though there was a fair amount of anxiety,
as there was in applying the striped coatings.

It is, of course, necessary to adjust the tilt, rotation, and focus of

each CCD fairly exquisitely; we allow 25 microns tilt error, 5 microns
rotation error, and 25 microns total piston error.  The tolerances on the
absolute x,y location of the CCD are not severe, since there is no really
significant software advantage to having
objects centered on the same
pixel on successive chips in the column and there is a 150-pixel overlap
between successive TDI strips, but in fact the CCD assemblies and the machining
and mounting 
of the optical benches has been done with sufficient precision that we
expect the chips to be located within about 10 microns of their nominal
positions. (We will not know for sure until the first TDI data on
the sky is in hand). The tilt adjustment
will be done on initial assembly of the ball and socket joint to
theoretical optical design values.  It can be changed on the basis of 
later tests but
only with some difficulty; we feel, however, that it is the most
reliable of the adjustments to predict.  The rotation is much the most
critical and will be done by the installation of a rigid lever on the
socket part of the assembled ball and socket which extends some distance
perpendicular to the optical bench.  
The optical bench will then be
mounted accurately parallel to the ways of a precision linear slide and
several reference points manufactured into the CCD which are exactly
aligned with the CCD columns will then be examined with an inspection
microscope as the optical bench assembly is moved along the slide.  The
rotational correction is then calculated and imposed by moving the lever
with a micrometer screw.  The lever arm translates the 5 micron
tolerance over the 5 cm length of the CCD column to about 50
microns, which is easily resolved by the micrometer actuator.  The
socket must fit into the receiving hole in the optical bench to quite
high precision, but the tolerances are not in fact very difficult with
modern techniques, and were easily met in manufacture. Piston
will be originally set with a set of shims to match the design
focal plane.  We expect to
have to trim both the rotation and focus at the mountain, hopefully
only once.
<P>

The dewar bodies themselves are machined of aluminum, and have O-ring

seals to the quartz in front and to a fitted lid which carries the
cooling system and electronics in back.  They are about 75 mm tall
and 330 mm long, so the atmospheric pressure on the sidewalls results
in about 2500 N when they are evacuated.  This is taken up
by a lip on the lid of the dewar in back and in front by a frame
machined integrally into the piece, which consists of horizontal bars
between the
filters.  Thus the forces do not act on any dimensionally critical
element.  A similar force in the focus direction acts to seal the quartz
to the dewar body, and demands that the face of dewar body be quite
accurately flat in order that it not distort the rear surface of the
corrector.  This would have no optical consequence, but would change the
effective shape of the focal plane.  This strong bond with the dewars
results in considerable stiffening of the corrector by the dewars, since
the Young's moduli of aluminum alloys and quartz are similar; though the
dewar walls are relatively thin (about 1 cm) they are twice as deep
as the corrector is thick, and most of the stiffness is in the dewars.  
The great
disparity of their thermal expansion coefficients, however, demands that
the joint be a low-friction one; thin fluoropolymer gaskets appear
adequate to the task.  When the dewar is removed, fixtures attached to
it bring the optical bench away with it for ease of maintenance.  The
optical bench can then be removed from the dewar through the top,
carrying the in-dewar circuit boards (see Section  
<A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#cameraelectronics">4.8</A> below)
with it. 
<P>

<H2>Cooling the Photometric Array</H2><P>

The dark currents for the Tek/SITe CCDs range from 30 to about 200

pA/cm&sup2  at 20&deg;C.  At -80 &deg;C, this is reduced by about a
factor of  3x10<sup>5</sup>, which for a 24 &micro;  pixel becomes 
0.01 electrons/second for 100 pA at room temperature.  
The sidereal-rate exposure time
of 55 seconds thus yields a dark signal of about 5 electrons, which does
not contribute significantly to the read noise.  The total thermal
losses for the dewar design we are using come to about 6 to 7 watts per
dewar, three watts from radiation (mostly from the active detector area
itself), 2 watts through the kinematic mounting, and another two from
miscellaneous sources such as radiation to the nitrogen container, conductive
losses through the flexible printed circuits (FPCs)
connecting the CCDs to their support circuitry,
conductive losses to the force actuators on the kinematic mounts, etc. 
<P>

We will use an autofill LN2 cooling system patterned after the one used

on the 4-shooter camera at Palomar (Gunn et al. 1987).  Each dewar 
(Figure <A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#photoDewarFig">4.7</A>) will
have a small LN2 container which holds about 200 ml of liquid, which
will keep the detectors cool for about an hour.  Under normal operating
conditions all the LN2 dewars vent through a common vacuum-jacketed
fill line and are kept under moderate pressure.  There is a temperature
sensor on the LN2 dewar body which is monitored continuously, and the
dewar is filled when its temperature rises, but normally the dewars are
filled on a schedule kept by the executive microprocessor (see below)
which ensures that they never go empty. The fill is accomplished by
opening all the solenoid valves on the individual vent lines and allowing
liquid under pressure to enter; these are
closed one by one as the dewars fill (as indicated by thermistor-based
liquid sensors in the vent lines).
<P>

The heat is conducted from the chips through the kovar ball mounts

cemented to them, and thence to copper posts which are connected via
silver straps (silver is only slightly more conductive
than copper but is nearly a factor of two more flexible at a given
cross-section) to a cold-finger on the base of the LN2 container, which
will also house a quantity of Zeolite molecular sieve getter.  The very
low heat conductivity of invar makes it difficult to keep the optical
bench isothermal, but we will keep the chips at a uniform constant
temperature with small make-up heaters associated with each CCD and
mounted to the copper posts,
as seen in Figure <A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#photoOpticBenchFig">4.5</A>, 
which attach directly to the CCD mounts. The
thermal expansion coefficient of invar is so small that small deviations
from isothermality have little effect on the dimensional relationship in
the bench.  The temperatures will be measured with small
platinum resistors fed with resistive dividers which result in reasonably
accurately linear response over the relevant temperature range. 
Sensors of the same type 
are used to monitor the temperature of the LN2 container.
<P>

On the saddle which carries the power supplies (see below) are mounted

two 10-liter intermediate supply dewars which supply the autofill system,
each one supplying LN2 for one astrometric and three photometric dewars.
These in turn are kept filled from a 160-liter dewar on the rotating
floor of the enclosure, using an autofill system of rather different
design.
<P>

<H2>The Astrometric/Focus Array: General</H2><P>

It is necessary to do pretty good relative astrometry simply to place

the fibers; with the other problems such as differential refraction with
wavelength and position, hole placement uncertainties, etc, it seems
necessary to find positions to accuracies of the order of 
200 mas (12 microns in the
focal plane) or so.  This is difficult to do with the imaging array,
because it saturates at about 14<sup>th</sup> magnitude in the bands useful for
astrometry ( g'  and  r' , with  r'  preferred because of the smaller
refraction corrections), and there are almost no astrometric standards
at this brightness level.  It would be in principle possible to
calibrate the camera astrometrically, but one would have to depend on
its stability and the stability of the telescope drives for relatively
long periods to make use of the calibrations without suffering
intolerable overheads.  It would also be very nice from an astronomical
point of view to do substantially better, and the astrometric CCDs
illustrated in Figure <A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#cameraAssemblyFig">4.2</A> facilitate this.
<P>

They should allow tying the

astrometric system of the survey eventually to the Hipparcos reference
frame with an accuracy of order 30 mas locally, and if the survey could
be redone in 10 years' time or so, would provide a wealth of proper
motion data for faint sources.  Even if there is no repeat, the utility
provided by tying a faint QSO system to the Hipparcos one would be felt
throughout astronomy.  The astrometry is discussed more fully in Chapter
<A HREF="../astrom/astrom.htm#astrom">6</A> with respect to performance, Chapter <A HREF="../strategy/strategy.htm#strategy">1</A> with
respect to the survey
strategy; 
here we address the hardware aspects. 
<P>

It is a simple job to scale the existing 2048-square mask set to a

nonsquare device with 2048 columns, so the astrometric CCDs are
the same width as the
photometric chips, but with fewer rows.  A mask set for a  2048x
400  device was designed and produced by SITe, and two foundry
runs of frontside devices made with it.
We need a less tall device simply to fit
into the available space above and below the photometric array, but
there are other compelling reasons to favor such a geometry.  We needed a
number of these devices (24) comparable to the number of photometric chips,
and it helped substantially
that they were very much cheaper than the photometric CCDs; a device which
is  2048 x 400 , which is the size we decided on, can be
made several to a wafer, and is correspondingly cheaper than the one-to-a-wafer
square
device.  Also, as we shall see, we require quite dense neutral filters
to be able to observe available astrometric standards, and the smaller
integration times associated with less tall chips allow us to use lower
densities. The same consideration leads us to use less sensitive (by a
factor of about 2) and much less expensive frontside illuminated
CCDs.  The disadvantage of the shorter columns is that the shorter
integration times lead to larger position errors because of
seeing-related image wander. 
<P>

We have from these runs about thirty good devices.

They have been mounted on precisely machined invar-36
headers of our design which allow the them to be mounted quite close
together in the column (short) direction, as shown in Figure
<A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#cameraAssemblyFig">4.2</A>; the
minimum distance is in fact determined by the necessary oversize of the
filters to allow for the f/5 beam.  The electrical signals to and from
the chips are carried by flexible printed circuits of Kapton with
very thin and narrow copper conductors.  These FPCs are mounted
permanently on the CCD headers and the chips are bonded out to pads
on the FPCs. 
<P>

For a chip 400 pixels high the integration time at the sidereal rate is

about 11 seconds, and we argue in Chapter <A HREF="../astrom/astrom.htm#astrom">6</A> that the
one-dimensional
positional accuracy achievable in that time is about 30-40 mas with the
seeing conditions which must prevail during the imaging survey.  These
chips can be run somewhat warmer than the photometric imaging devices 
because we
are not interested in low signal-to-noise objects and the integration
time is short. Cooling to -60 &deg;C is
sufficient, which yields a background of about 10-20 electrons per
pixel in the 11 second integration time for these devices.
The centroid of a star which
deposits about 2000 electrons can be measured to about 30 mas (shot and
readout noise errors alone) in 1 arcsecond seeing with this background. 
A star which saturates in the central pixel ( 4 x 10<sup>5</sup>e<sup>-</sup>
for these devices) has a
total signal of about  4x 10<sup>6</sup> electrons, so the dynamic range for
30 mas accuracy, considering shot and read noise alone, is about 
8.3 magnitudes. 
<P>

We will use the astrometric sensors in the  r'  band, which seems optimum.

With no further attenuation, they
will saturate at about 11.3, and one can do 30 mas astrometry to
about 19.5.  This is not particularly useful, since the Hipparcos net
and the AGK3 have very few objects as faint as 11.3.  We will use 3.0
magnitude neutral filters, for a useful range of 8.3 to 16.5  
This filtration results in
an overlap of about 2.5 magnitudes between saturation of the imaging array
(about 14.0), and the 30 mas accuracy limit for the astrometric array,
and there are more than 200 stars per square degree in that magnitude
interval near the pole. Thus the frame defined by the astrometric chips
and the one defined by the red imaging chips (and with only a little
more difficulty, that defined by any band in the imaging array) can be
tied together very accurately indeed.  Most of the Hipparcos stars are
fainter than 7th, so more dynamic range would not really be useful.
<P>

We will use a total of 24 of these devices, one at each end of each

column of photometric CCDs, 5 across the top and bottom of the array to
tie the columns together, and two outside these to provide focus
information.  The sensors at the bottom provide a check on the tracking
rate and direction; stars cross the bottom set 7.5 minutes after they
cross the top, and they go through the red photometric sensors at 1.4
minutes.  Thus drive errors with frequencies lower than  2 x
10<sup>-3</sup>  Hz can be corrected for, and we can monitor higher frequencies
statistically.  The astrometric and red sensors define a continuous
frame which will drift slowly with respect to any initially defined
absolute frame because we are basically measuring rates.  We will use
the astrometric standards only to pin this instrumental frame to the sky
at intervals (see Chapter <A HREF="../astrom/astrom.htm#astrom">6</A>). 
<P>

There are about 1.5 Hipparcos stars per square degree in our magnitude

interval, and the array will encounter one every 70 seconds on average. 
If the drives can be held to the accuracy we would like (25 mas rms
stochastic component in the frequency interval  2x 10<sup>-3</sup>  to
 3x 10<sup>-1</sup>  Hz), as seems very likely from measured errors on
the manufactured parts, tying the survey to the
Hipparcos net to 30 mas should be possible; in any case, we should be
limited to the errors imposed by seeing, which is our goal.
<P>

<H2>Mechanical Design of the Astrometric/Focus Array</H2>The linear dimension associated with 30 mas is about 2 microns, and
achieving dimensional stability to this order over a focal plane as
large as ours is not an easy task.  Invar-36 has a thermal coefficient
of expansion of about  1.5x 10<sup>-6</sup> /&deg;C, and a one-degree temperature
change induces a dimensional change over the 455 mm width of the array
of 0.7 &micro;, so one-degree temperature control is adequate.  The
coefficient for silicon is similar, so changes on the scale of one chip
with reasonable temperature control are negligible.  Our approach to the
astrometric array is thus very similar to that for the photometric; the
chips are mounted on invar-36 headers (which are machined so that the
curvature in the long dimension is similar to the curvature of the
square photometric devices) with a thin compliant conductive epoxy film. 
These headers are mounted with screws onto an invar optical bench (which
now, of course, goes <I>across</I> the array) on invar shims which are 
machined with the
tilts necessary to fit the field curvature.  The shorter vertical
dimension means that rotation is not so critical, and shimming for
piston will be the only adjustment normally performed.  The optical
bench is located to the corrector with kinematic mounts of the same sort
as used in the photometric dewars, but here the pillars are much smaller,
shorter, and are made of invar instead of quartz.
(see Figure <A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#cameraAssemblyFig">4.2</A>). The optical bench is housed in
an aluminum
dewar attached to the corrector in the same fashion as the photometric
ones, again with an O-ring seal against the quartz.  Reinforcing the
dewar against transverse atmospheric pressure is trickier in this case
than in the photometric case because there is no clear place to put a
spreader bar close to the focal plane with the chips overlapping as they
do, but spreaders behind the main horizontal web of the optical bench through
holes in the vertical web serve here. This complicates the assembly
somewhat, but not disastrously so.
<P>

The dimensional relationship between front and rear ranks of the

astrometrics is also crucial to control, since that determines
the accuracy with which errors in the drive rate and direction
can be measured. This is greatly facilitated by our use of the quartz
corrector as the metering substrate, and the dimensions should not
be much less accurately maintained than those within one of the
optical benches, particularly when one considers that the deflections
associated with the kinematic mounts are the same for the front
and rear benches (and furthermore quite similar to those for the
photometric benches).
<P>

At an operating temperature of -60 &deg;C the total heat load to the

astrometric optical bench is about 6 watts, roughly the same as the
photometric dewars.  We have decided for simplicity and economy to use
a cooling system essentially identical to the one adopted for the 
photometric dewars, and in fact one which shares many parts with its
photometric counterpart. 
In this case we must endeavor to keep the bench as isothermal as
possible.  The bench has a cross-section of about 7 cm&sup2;, and the
conductivity of invar is about 0.2 watt/&deg;C-cm, so a flux of 1 watt
in the bench is associated with a temperature gradient of about 0.7&deg;
per cm.  Temperature <I>differences</I> across the bench of 1 &deg;C
induce a bow in the bench with an amplitude of about 1&micro;.  We will
distribute the heat load from the bench to a heavy cold
bar attached to the LN2 container's coldfinger at four points along
the optical bench, again using thin silver straps. 
This will result in temperature inhomogeneities
of the order of 1 degree, but in a pattern which should remain quite
stable and hence innocuous astrometrically.
<P>

<H2>Focus</H2><P>

It is clear that one of the major contributions to image degradation

in normal observing circumstances is the inability to keep up with focus
changes brought about by flexure and temperature changes, and we
will address this problem at the outset. Our requirements are
especially severe because of the astrometry, but it appears that a
simple scheme will suffice to provide excellent control.
<P>

There are two astrometric-type sensors housed in the astrometric dewars

which will be used as focus sensors; though they are quite far from
the center, the image quality is quite good at their location.
They will have only an  r'  filter with no neutral density; this filter
is cut into three parts, and the optical thickness associated with the
neutral filter on the other sensors is taken up by three clear glass spacers
of varying thickness. When the the rest of the array is in focus, 
the center of the focus chip is also, but the ends are, respectively,
300 microns inside and outside of focus; this defocus, which results
in image degradation from defocus comparable to the expected 1 arcsecond
seeing, is optimal from a focus-determination signal-to-noise point of view.
Comparison of the images
in the two outer thirds  will provide a sensitive differential measure of the
focus, which we will adjust dynamically; the resolution of the secondary
motion is such that that should cause us no difficulty. Figure
<A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#focusImageFig">4.8</A> shows
images at five positions on the focus sensor through focus with 150 &micro; 
focus steps, as produced by the design 
optical system and convolved with 0.8-arcsecond
Gaussian seeing.

Focusing the camera.

the images as produced by the telescope, the right convolved with
0.8 arcsecond Gaussian seeing.<HR>
<! >
We need to control the focus very accurately to maintain astrometric
accuracy. If we want 2 &micro; positional accuracy in the focal plane,
we must control the focus to about 35 &micro;, since the maximum angle
which the central ray makes to the focal plane is about 0.055 radian.
Focus errors this large contribute only 7 &micro;  RMS to the image
diameters and are negligible, but we would like the focus errors
to be negligible for the astrometric determinations as well. The
factors which contribute to focus errors are residual aberrations
across the field of the focus chips, photon statistics, and, of course,
seeing.
The focus errors from aberrations and photon statistics (the actual 
errors will almost certainly be dominated by <I>seeing</I>) are about 3 microns 
for any star brighter than about  r' =15.5, the limit set by psf variations
across the focus chip. For fainter objects, photon noise becomes important
and the errors are about 6 microns at 17.0, 9 at 18.0, and 20 at 19.0. 
At the galactic pole, the star counts are about 250, 500, 820, and 
1300 per square degree brighter than 15.5, 17, 18, and 19, respectively, 
and fainter than the saturation limit at  r' =11.5. The three focus zones 
are each about 4 arcminutes wide, so the camera will see about 0.0167 
square degrees per minute of time in each of the zones. Thus it will see 
4 stars brighter than 15.5, 8 brighter than 17, 13 brighter than 18, and
21 brighter than 19 per minute. The timescale for focus changes is
not known at this point, but the thermal time constant for the telescope
is of the order of an hour, so it seems not unreasonable to expect that
one can effectively average over a hundred to a few hundred stars to generate
a focus signal, and the statistical errors will be completely negligible.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="cameraelectronics">The Electronics</A></H2>We will pack the clock drivers and the preamps in the dewars as we have
always done in the Palomar systems to minimize noise (Gunn and Westphal
1981).  There are monolithic FET-input operational amplifiers now
(Burr-Brown OPA627s) which will serve as preamplifiers with
noise performance almost equivalent to the more complex discrete ones 
we have used in the past, but with much better overall speed and
settling behavior.  The optical design has sufficiently good distortion
characteristics, as we discussed in the last section, to allow clocking
all the chips in the array synchronously, so the driver and digital
control circuitry is also very simple.  These two facts keep the
in-dewar circuitry simple and compact, though the sheer number of
sensors makes the system and particularly the interconnections rather
complex.  We have designed, produced, and tested the entire complement of
surface-mount printed circuit cards for the dewar circuitry, which
includes two small (43 mm  x  53mm) piggy-back polyimide printed circuit
cards, one for the
preamp proper and the other for the clock drivers.  The latter are CMOS
analog switches with RC pulse-shaping circuitry on the inputs
to the CCD gates (Figure <A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#dewarFig">4.9</A>).  The CCDs are electrically
connected to this assembly via a 25-conductor kapton flexible printed 
circuit with very thin copper conductors. This FPC terminates in a 
connector on the preamp board and is soldered to a polyimide PC card
which acts as a socket for the CCD on the other end.

as two small piggybacked surface-mount cards which are mounted on 
the dewar wall.<HR>
<P>

Each CCD is associated with either one or two analog signal chain

channels; the Tek/SITe chips have split serial registers and we
originally hoped that we would be able to obtain all our devices with
two good amplifiers on at least one of the serial registers.  This would
have allowed us to use rather slow readout, with correspondingly good
noise performance.  As it turned out, it was expedient to accept a small
number of devices (6) with only one good amplifier, which we have to run
twice as fast.  The noise penalty is only about a factor of 1.3, and in
most cases is not a serious problem. We strongly considered running <I>all</I>
of the devices with one amplifier, but unfortunately not all the devices
will run fast enough. 
Thus the electronics is not quite synchronous, there being
two serial clocking schemes, one running exactly twice as fast as the 
other but both generated from a single master clock and locked in phase.
<P>

The architecture of the serial registers on the devices is

such that there are 20 `extended' pixels between the edge of the
imaging array and the on-chip source follower amplifier, and we will
read another 20 overscan pixels in the two-amplifier chips, so each
half-row will consist of 1024 + 20 + 20 = 1064 pixels.  The
single-amplifier chips will have the 20 leading and trailing extended
pixels at either end of the data pixels and will in addition have 40
overscan pixels at the end.  At sidereal scanning rate, the scale of
3.643mm/arcminute corresponds to 38.05 lines/sec, or 26.28
ms/line. The vertical transfers require about 700 &micro;s, leaving
25.58 ms per line. At 24 &micro;s per pixel, the time for 1064 pixels
is 25.54 ms. (The fast channels run at 12 &micro;s per pixel, clearly.) We
need about 32 master clock cycles per pixel for all the functions in a
classical dual-slope double-correlated sampling system, so a 1.3333
MHz (750 ns) clock yields 24-microsecond pixels. This will be derived
from an 8 MHz master clock, which is needed by the A/D converters and
the data transmitters.

The preamplifiers are AC coupled to the output of the CCDs through a
more-or-less classical `back-porch' clamp which has no time-constant
effects during the critical sampling period.  The coupling through the
rest of the system is DC.  The output of the preamplifiers goes to a
simple dual-slope integrator which is also used as a hold amplifier for
the input to the A/Ds.  The latter are Crystal Semiconductor CS5101As,
which convert to 16 bits in 8 &micro;s with an 8 MHz input clock (fast enough
for both the slow and fast channels) and which
have internal calibration circuitry which keeps the internal accuracy at
&plusmn;&frac14 LSB.  The circuitry for this is illustrated in Figure
<A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#signalChainFig">4.10</A>, and
the timing diagram in Figure <A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#timingFig">4.11</A>.
<P>

There is some

question about whether 16 bits is enough (probably academic, since at
the moment more accurate converters in this speed range are not readily
available), but the problem is not severe.  In the  g' ,  r' , and  i' 
bands the sky levels are such that digitizing at roughly 5 electrons/(AD unit)
results in a step which is small compared to the standard deviation in
the background, and accommodates with 16 bits the full 300,000 electron
full well of the device.  In the  u'  chips the situation is not quite
so good.  The sky in each chip is only of order 50 electrons, and the noise
with 5 electrons read noise per chip is 9.  If we demand that we
digitize at at least two levels per unit sigma, this will result in a
digital full well of slightly less than the physical full well of
the CCD.  This is not a serious problem, however, since the fluxes and
efficiencies are such that no object which does not saturate in one of
the other bands is likely to overflow the  u'  A/D. 
<P>

The CCD voltages and the voltages required to trim the dual-slope

circuitry are generated by a set of three octal 8-bit DACs, Maxim 528s,
for each chip. These converters have serial input, and all the
converters in the system are daisy-chained to be set up with one very
long serial word. The output voltages are sampled and placed on
an output bus for measurement with a set of serial-input 8-position
analog switches. The circuit for this voltage generator and monitor
is shown in Figure <A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#voltageBoardFig">4.12</A>. The signal chain electronics and
this circuit are
implemented in surface-mount technology on opposite sides of
one small 8-layer Eurocard, all of which again have been constructed
and tested.
There is one of these cards per chip on the photometric camera. Some
of these cards, associated with the single-amplifier chips, use only
one signal channel, but all the cards are identical except for the input
resistors which are used to trim the gains to match the individual output
amplifier gains for each CCD, and the integrator capacitor, which is
a different value for the fast single-amplifier circuitry. 
Thus each photometric dewar
contains 5 of these cards, plus one card which is basically a bus
receiver for the clock signals described in the next paragraph; the
astrometrics employ 6 plus a bus receiver; <I>all</I> of the astrometric
chips run with only one amplifier to save cards and space, and so we
run two chips with each signal-chain-bias card -- the performance
penalty is negligible.
<P>

<H4><A NAME="voltageBoardFig">Figure 4.12</A></H4>
<IMG ALIGN="MIDDLE" ALT="bias2.gif" SRC="../camera/bias2.gif"><P>
A schematic for the voltage generator board for the
SDSS cameras. All the voltages are generated by DACs and the
board also has provision for placing any voltage on a measurement
bus for monitoring.<HR>
<P>

The clock signals are generated from programs stored in EPROMs and

controlled by a Forth microcontroller using a Hitachi H8/532 CPU from
Triangle Data Systems.  One controller runs the entire camera; all CCDs
are clocked synchronously with identical clocking waveforms (though
there are two sets of serial waveforms for the `fast' and `slow' chips.)
The voltage rails for all voltages can be optimized for each chip.  The
controller has two such CPUs, one of which is busy continuously
generating the CCD signals, and the other of which (the `executive')
is keeping track of other housekeeping chores, such as control of the
shutters, initial DAC voltage setup, voltage and temperature monitoring
(the micro has an on-chip 10-bit A/D), etc.  We
monitor all the operating voltages (the CCD temperatures are part of
this set) on a round-robin basis, measuring one voltage per line time. 
There are 22 voltages for each of 54 CCDs, so the process requires about
32 seconds for one cycle.  The ADC setting requires a word a little more
than 10000 bits long, which will have a leading checkbyte which is
received back at the transmitter after making the entire rounds.  The
clock will be slow, 10kHz, and so the setup time is 1 second.  All
signals are sent from the controller by balanced RS485 transmitters and
received at each dewar by complementary receivers.  All signals except
the 8 MHz master clock are carried on a 100-conductor ribbon cable bus. 
The control for the camera comes over a single `RS232' fiber pair to the
executive micro.  There is considerable flexibility for controlling the
chips with this scheme; we implement on-chip binning both
horizontally and vertically (independently) and allow some control of
the sampling interval. There is, in particular, a "quick" mode in
which the CCD clocking is identical to that usually employed but which
cuts the sampling time by a factor of five.  This allows the chips to be
read at twice the usual speed with a noise penalty of a factor of 2.3,
which is useful for calibration exposures for the
spectrographs (this mode cannot be used for the camera, because the single-
channel chips cannot be run this quickly owing to the limitations of the
ADCs).  We will also have the capability to bin very heavily
vertically, which will be used in spectrophotometric calibration for the
spectrographs. 
<P>

The Crystal A/Ds have a serial output, which is fed (again over RS485)

to a pair of small cards mounted piggyback on the dewars which carry
RS485 receivers,
circuitry to format the data for the single-channel chips to resemble
that for the dual-channel chips (in the time domain),
a programmable logic chip which acts as a
serial-to-parallel converter and multiplexer, and a fiber-optic FOXI
transmitter to send the data to the DA system in the operations
building.  Each of these cards is capable of handing 12 slow
data channels or 6 fast ones or any admixture. Each
photometric dewar has one and each astrometric dewar 2, for a total of
10 data fibers for the 10 DA computers (see Chapter <A HREF="../datasys/datasys.htm#datared">10</A>). 
<P>

Each voltage-generator/signal chain card dissipates 2.8 W, the bus

receiver and a voltage regulator-voltage distribution board about a watt
each, so the photometric dewars dissipate about 16 watts each and the
astrometrics about 20 watts.  This waste heat is handled by
the cooling system for the telescope. The camera enclosure acts as
a semi-sealed chamber in which air is both generally circulated 
and blown specifically into the electronic enclosures associated with
each dewar; the heat exchanged into the air is removed with two
liquid-cooled heat exchangers on the fans. Water-glycol is provided
to these exchangers at about two degrees below ambient, the goal being to
keep the camera enclosure at ambient temperature. A similar scheme is used
in the camera power supplies.
<P>

The power supplies are not mounted directly with the camera but are carried

on a separate "saddle" which is mounted with, travels with, and is 
dismounted with the camera
but is mounted to both the cart and the telescope mechanically and
thermally independently. The saddle also carries two ten-liter 
intermediate "holding" dewars which supply LN2 to the small-capacity
LN2 containers associated with each CCD dewar.
Each dewar has its own power
supply, each of which is implemented using small encapsulated linear
supplies on a
single  20x25  cm printed-circuit card. Each supply carries
a fairly sophisticated monitoring and shutdown system mounted on a separate
smaller PC card. The supplies are packaged in two identical chassis, each
set serving one astrometric and three photometric dewars. There is in each
chassis also an "auxiliary" supply to run the control micros, the LN2
system, the fans, solenoid valves, etc.
<P>

Thus the camera has a

power cable which is made up of ten identical dewar power cables, an
RS232 fiber pair, and ten data fibers as electrical connections to the outside
world.  It has in addition cooling water/glycol, a single
vacuum-jacketed LN2 supply, pressurized N2 for the shutters, and
pressurized N2 and vacuum for the dewar kinematic mount force actuators.
<P>

Identical analog electronics are used on the spectrographs; there

there will be a controller per spectrograph, so each spectrograph has a
data fiber, and since those CCDs are not used in TDI mode, there is no
need for an executive micro.  The spectrograph dewars are copies of the
Palomar 4-shooter dewars and will employ the same autofill system as the
photometric camera. 
<P>

<H2>The CCDs</H2><P>

This whole project hinged quite visibly on the availability of many 

(42, including
spares) 2048  x  2048 CCD sensors, at least 8 of which need
excellent UV sensitivity and very low readout noise ( &lt; 5  electrons.) At
the inception of the work more than ten
years ago, it was by no means obvious that the chips could be obtainable. 
The project is really not viable in anything like its present conception
without them, and though quite powerful surveys could be pursued with
smaller detectors, we would either have given up a great deal which we believe
is vital, have been stuck with an impossibly complex system (would you <I>really</I> like to align a focal plane with 120 1024  x  1024 CCDs
and tend to their electronics?) or extend the survey time-to-completion
unconscionably.

Five CCDs on an optical bench, with the gold plated heat
shield in place.<HR>
<P>

The situation improved very markedly in the intervening years.  Tektronix

produced large numbers of 2048 x 2048
21-micron pixel devices as part of NASA's STIS
program for the second-generation Hubble Space Telescope
instrumentation, and went on to produced for our project a foundry 
run of excellent
24-micron devices, from which we were delivered 5 working and two
excellent chips.  Subsequent to that, we negotiated a contract for
all the chips for the survey, photometric and astrometric/focus, with
SITe, the now-independent Tektronix CCD division.  Our cosmetic
requirements are quite different from most of SITe's customers, since
TDI gets rid of a whole suite of defects which would mar performance
in normal imaging mode, and they agreed to deliver chips with 
special grading for us at a price somewhat below that for their normal
Grade 1 devices. This arrangement was spectacularly successful, and we
now have in hand and have fully characterized all the chips for the
project (including the camera, the Monitor Telescope, and the spectrographs)
including spares.
Five CCDs,  mounted on their optical bench, are shown in Figure
<A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#ccdFig">4.13</A>.  This picture shows the CCD complement for one of the
six photometric dewars.
<P>

The charge-transfer problems which plagued the early large devices were

solved and considerable progress made toward effective
antireflection coatings and backside treatment for high stable quantum
efficiencies in the blue and near ultraviolet.  The engineers at SITe
pursued two paths toward ultraviolet sensitivity; one
of
implantation techniques to keep the backside properly charged, and the
other of coatings to reduce the severe reflection losses in the blue and
near UV.  They have consistently produced chips with better than 50% QE
at 3500 &Aring;.  The quantum efficiency for thinned CCDs with the
"standard" and the delivered UV AR coating are shown in Figure
<A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#photoQEFig">4.14</A>. One disappointment we have had is that this high UV
QE declines substantially at low (operating) temperatures, but still is
in the vicinity of 40% for all our devices at -80 &deg;C at 3500 &Aring;.
<P>

Quantum efficiency curves.  Data are shown  for the standard
AR coating (dashed) and for the new UV AR coating (solid) on thinned SITE CCDs.
The QE for the unthinned chips (dotted) is shown also for comparison.<HR>
<P>

The new chips have many of the latest `wrinkles'; there is a

mini-channel in the columns for very good low-level charge transfer
efficiency, the chips can be run in MPP mode (not, unfortunately, in the
scanning array, since they are clocking all the time), and have
amplifiers with very small geometry for the lowest possible noise. 
<P>

The chips are designed and bonded out so that the four quadrants can be

read independently, which for many applications results in a factor of 4
improvement in readout time; for us, it is the split in the serial
direction which is useful, since we must integrate over the full chip
vertically.  
It would be well to have all four amplifiers working for
the spectroscopic chips, but that is sadly not the case for the chips in
hand.  The readout time for a two-amplifier chip is about 1 minute, or
30 seconds in the higher-noise `quick' mode, which can be used for
spectroscopic flat fields and wavelength calibrations. 
<P>

The devices were first characterized roughly at SITe and sent to

Princeton for final evaluation.  We have a cold test station which is
controlled by a 486 PC which has electronics similar to 
the survey electronics.  The system noise is about
1 electron, and we have the capability to measure CTE, quantum
efficiency as a function of wavelength, uniformity, and also to test the
vertical CTE in TDI mode using a special parallel-bar target and a
flashlamp.  The technique involves running the chip for some time with a
uniform "sky" background of appropriate level, and then exposing the
bar target, which consists of about 200 thin bright lines parallel to
the rows of the CCD, with a flashlamp to impose a low-level signal. 
This frame of data is then captured as the chip continues to scan in TDI
mode, and the bars are superposed to simulate a single such bar
traveling along the chip following the charge packets.  Doing this is
important, because some low-level parallel traps which show up in single
frames are satiated by the sky in TDI mode and disappear; other stronger
traps permanently damage the CTE in the affected columns.

<! >
<P>

Our specifications allowed for single bad columns, the notion being that

we are well-enough sampled that we can effectively interpolate across
one bad column, but two or more contiguous ones disqualify a device from
our consideration.  Interpolation does, of course, affect the
statistical accuracy of the photometry of objects affected by the
column, but that is easy to keep track of and account for in the data
reduction.  The spectroscopic chips will be arranged so that the spectra
are along columns, because the defects in CCDs are almost always along
columns; thus even catastrophic column defects simply wipe out the
spectra from a few fibers which we know about and can simply avoid
using, and we have so <I>many</I>.  Here, unlike the situation with the
imaging array, we <I>prefer</I> for a given number of defects for them
to be grouped, though here again the loss of a single column in a
spectrum is not necessarily a disaster.  This is but one example of our
special requirements. 
<P>

Partial blocked columns, for example, show up in TDI as columns with

stably depressed quantum efficiency, and if the fraction of the column
blocked is not too large has almost no effect.  Likewise single hot
column defects are integrated over and can be simply subtracted out if
the noise contribution is not too great or interpolated over if it is. 
<P>

Our chips all have good to excellent electrical performance,

with amplifier noise varying between 2.5 and 10 electrons for all
devices accepted for use in the three bluest bands, and a few with
noise as high as 20 for the  i'  and  z'  bands, 
where the sky background will be
about 1000 electrons per pixel. The median noise is
near 5 electrons, and we measure CTEs 
of around 0.99998 horizontally and 0.99994
vertically at illumination levels of 30 electrons.  This improves to
about 0.999993 horizontally and 0.99998 vertically at 300 electrons,
which is typical of all the expected backgrounds except for the
ultraviolet.  At the lower level, which is somewhat less than the
ultraviolet sky level, the net transfer efficiency is 86 percent from
the upper center of the chip (the pixel with the largest number of
transfers).  This represents a shift of 0.02 pixel horizontally and 0.07
pixel vertically (averaging over the column as TDI does) and completely
negligible PSF degradation.  For the higher-background chips these
numbers are more like 0.007 pixel horizontally and .02 pixel vertically.
The overall cosmetic uniformity is excellent as well, with RMS large-scale
QE variations of about 7% in the blue and 4% in the red and
infrared. The main defects we have seen are parallel traps of various
strengths, many of which are strong enough to cause serious CTE degradation
in the vertical direction with the backgrounds we are using, though
again they are not fatal if they involve only one column. A subimage
in the corner farthest from the amplifier
taken with a quite typical device of a ronchi target with 30 electrons
signal in the bright bars is shown in Figure <A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#ronchiFig">4.15</A>, in which the
excellent cosmetics and low-level CTE is seen.
<P>

We elected to take chips mounted in their standard kovar packages even

though this led to significant mechanical difficulty in their mounting
and cooling; demanding better packaging would have precluded culling our
devices from a commercial production stream and would have prohibitively
increased the cost. The problems incurred are fairly serious, however.
The expansion coefficient of kovar matches silicon (and the substrate
for the thinned devices, which <I>does</I> match silicon well) so
poorly that the overall curvature of the devices, already serious at
room temperature because of problems in high-temperature processing,
is much worse at operating temperature. As mentioned above, the chips are 
convex toward the incoming light by about 230 microns center to corner, and
that value roughly doubles cooling to -80 C. We have dealt with this both
for the spectroscopic and photometric chips by cementing a heavy kovar
stiffener to the back; in the case of the photometric chips, this is
part of the ball tilt mounting. It was also necessary to build a precision
measuring microscope to aid in the gluing of the photometric chips, since
we wished to position the chips to pixel-or-subpixel accuracy and the chips
are not mounted very accurately in their headers. We thus used reference
points on the die itself to reference the CCD to its ball mount, and 
succeeded in doing so to an accuracy of about 3 microns RMS.
<P>

Our requirements for spectral sensitivity and noise vary a great deal

across the array, though for the  u'  chips (7 with spares; we have
spared the equivalent of a complete 5-chip dewar) we certainly require
both good UV sensitivity <I>and</I> very low noise.  The original
requirements we imposed are summarized in Table <A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#ccdComplementTab">4.2</A>.
The chips we have received and will use are better than these specs in
most respects. The operating temperature quantum efficiencies are well 
exceeded in all devices except those for the  u'  band; the mean
qe for the  z'  chips is 14 %; for the  i' , 60%; for the  r' , 78%;
for the  g' , 70%; and for the  u' , 38%; the dispersions in these
numbers are small and probably dominated by measuring error. 
We have built in to the dewars
UV floodlamps and can use them to enhance the UV quantum efficiencies
to approximately the spec 45%, but whether we will use them or not
is a complex operational issue, since the effects of UV flooding are
not permanent and there is a significant dark current penalty.
The noise specs are also all met except for the  u' , where the worst
figure is 6.4 electrons.
<P>

It goes almost without saying that the development of these

devices for the survey has had tangible benefits for all of optical
astronomy. Though the major thrust of wafer-scale large CCDs has now 
gone toward
devices with more but smaller pixels resulting in slightly smaller
devices overall, the production of these chips with high yield depends
heavily on techniques learned here.
