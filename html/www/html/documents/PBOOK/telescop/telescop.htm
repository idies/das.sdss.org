<H2>Optical Design</H2><P>

<H3>General Considerations</H3>The desiderata are a telescope of about 2.5 meter aperture, of a scale
and focal ratio well adapted both to fibers for a many-fiber
spectrograph, and to the pixel size of available large-format CCDs for a
time-delay-and-integrate (TDI) imaging survey.  The telescope should
have a field which is as large as practicable, and which should lend
itself to the use of fiber-fed spectrographs.  The size and throughput
of the overall system should allow the efficient acquisition of spectra
of galaxies at our spectroscopic limit of  r' = 18.15 .  As outlined
in this section, we believe that 
we have succeeded
in producing a design for such an instrument which is simple and yields
excellent performance, with a focal plane well-matched to the unusual
requirements of TDI imaging.  The ray trace image sizes are less than 0.6
arcseconds RMS over a three-degree field at the design wavelength, and
are less than 0.7 arcseconds RMS in any of our filter passbands 
over the imaging wavelength range of 3500
to 9300&Aring;.  The lateral color is very small, of order 5
microns (0.1 arcseconds) over the whole field over the spectroscopic
wavelength range of 4000 to 9000&Aring;.  The dominant aberration in the
spectroscopic mode (with its demand for wideband imaging)
is longitudinal color, which creates images larger than 1
arcsecond RMS (to be compared to the 3 arcsecond fibers we will use) 
only at extreme field angles at the
ends of the spectrum. 
<P>

While wide-field optical designs

exist for such focal ratios (the Baker-Paul three-mirror design, for
example, and more recent variants, and the Schmidt, of course) they all
suffer from either excessive length for a 2.5 meter aperture or an
inaccessible focal plane, which renders the fiber spectroscopy
difficult.  Early design efforts revealed that there appeared to be some hope
(which we realize below) that a more-or-less conventional
Ritchey-Chr&eacute;tien-like optical system would deliver the requisite
performance while working with a focal ratio about  f/5, which we need
to match our chosen detectors.
<P>

After quite extensive exploration, it was determined that the

CCD division of Tektronix was the only viable supplier for focal plane 
arrays which satisfied the requirements for quantity, large format, and 
broadband sensitivity. After our contract with Tektronix
was well under way, an independent entity, Scientific Imaging Technologies
(SITe), purchased the CCD division and its contracts.
The need for good ultraviolet 
response dictated the use of thinned backside-treated devices; the UV 
fluxes are so low that very low readout noise was also required.  With 
24 micron pixels, the SITe devices provide excellent focal plane image 
sampling at about f/5 with our expected image size of about 1 arcsecond
FWHM. This combination yields 0.4 arcsecond pixels, about 2.5 pixels per 
FWHM, and about 1 percent total power in a gaussian star image beyond the
Nyquist frequency.
<P>

Efficient fibers are available in diameters of 100 to 600 microns which

preserve well focal ratios faster than about  f/7, and which suffer
hardly any degradation at focal ratios around  f/5.  Fibers which
subtend about three arcseconds are needed to cover the bright parts of
galaxies in the brightness range of interest.  The scale at  f/5, 60.6
microns per arcsecond, requires 180 micron fibers, which have excellent
optical performance if handled and terminated properly and also give
good sampling for the 24 micron pixels of the large Tektronix/SITe imaging
arrays at the demagnified focus of the spectrographs.
The focal ratio, therefore, was fixed at  f/5.0. 
<P>

As pointed out in the design report for the Swope and Iren&eacute;e DuPont

telescopes by Bowen and Vaughan (1973) it is possible to design a
Ritchey-Chr&eacute;tien telescope with a flat field by making the curvatures of
the primary and secondary mirrors the same, which yields zero Petzval
curvature in the focal plane.  Since a Gascoigne astigmatism corrector
is required, and since this element introduces a bit of positive field
curvature, the design needs to deviate a little from this prescription,
but not by very much.  This results in a final focal ratio of just under
twice the primary ratio, depending a little on the back focal distance,
and a very large secondary, about half the primary diameter for the
field sizes obtainable with  f/4 primaries (about 3 degrees).  For
large telescopes one would like to get around the limitation of slow
primaries and large secondaries.  These desiderata were met in the
design of the 2.5-meter DuPont telescope with the introduction of only
moderate field curvature. 
<P>

<H3>The Design</H3>The instrument described here uses the same philosophy taken to even
faster primary and overall  f/ratio.  Our requirements are rather
unusual for an astronomical instrument, since we must accomplish TDI imaging
over a large field.  This requires that field of view distortion be 
carefully controlled, since either a change of scale or a differential 
deviation from conformality of the mapping of the sky onto the focal plane 
across a chip translates immediately into image degradation.  It is easy to 
show, in fact, that for the pixel sizes and CCD sizes of interest, <I>no</I>
axially symmetric optical design is satisfactory for large enough field
angles.  For a three-degree field, troubles with mapping a sphere onto
the focal plane cause image degradation of the order of 0.15 arcsecond,
which with 0.5 arcsecond images is negligible, but the errors grow like
the square of the field diameter.  The desired map (onto a flat focal
plane) is one which creates a Mercator-like projection of the sky
onto the focal plane, with both parallels of `latitude' (i.e. curves of
constant angular separation from a great circle through the center of
the field in the scan direction) and meridians mapped into straight
lines, but no such map is axially symmetric, and anamorphic optics, which 
would be required for such a map, have not been investigated.
The errors for a zero-distortion design are in
any case not excessive with our field.  Conventional Ritchey designs
have two orders of magnitude too much distortion for this application. 
<P>

In addition, conventional Ritchey designs with Gascoigne correctors 

this fast have unacceptably
large lateral color, both for this imaging application and (especially)
for the fiber spectroscopy.  We were therefore compelled to go to somewhat more
complex systems, and have evolved a design with a two-element refracting
corrector which has excellent performance.  It makes use of the fact
that the astigmatism correction of a Gascoigne plate goes as the square
of the distance from the focal plane for a given strength, while the
lateral color and distortion only go linearly.  Thus a pair of plates,
one of the usual form and of weak power placed some distance from the focal
plane, and another the negative of the usual form of  n  times the strength of
the first placed 1/ n<sup>th</sup> the distance of the first from the focus, can
correct astigmatism while introducing no lateral color or distortion. 
Distortion remains at a level (12 microns over the field of the camera) 
set by the order of the
aspheric used for the second corrector element and can in principle be
removed (or specified) exactly; the lateral color is less than 10
microns peak-to-peak over the whole field over the spectral range of the
spectrograph, and is a negligible contribution to the image diameter
for any filter or field location in the camera. 
<P>

The design presented here has almost zero distortion in the sense that

the radius in the focal plane is proportional, to high accuracy, to the
field angle (not its sine or tangent); zero distortion for most
wide-field imaging is defined for the condition that the radius in the
focal plane is proportional to the <I>tangent</I> of that angle, which
results in faithful representations of figures on <I>planes</I>, but we
wish as faithfully as possible to image figures on a sphere onto a
surface which is almost planar.  For this case a compromise is necessary
between the wishes for constant scale in the sense that meridians have
constant linear separation in the focal plane, and the desire that
parallels of latitude do likewise.  The optimum case depends somewhat on
the aspect ratio of the field and is somewhere between the radius in the
focal plane going like the sine of the input angle and its tangent.  For
a square focal plane, which is close to the situation at hand, the
radius approximately proportional to the angle itself is best, 
and we have made this
choice.  The errors can be minimized by clocking different chips at
different rates to correspond to the local scale along the columns, but
we have chosen for reasons of noise reduction and simplicity in the data
system to clock all CCDs synchronously.  Our design results for the best
compromise tracking rate in worst-case image smearing along the columns
of 0.06 arcseconds, 3 microns, or 0.14 pixels over the imaging array.
Stars do not quite follow straight trajectories in the
focal plane, but this is compensated for by a slight rotation of
the outer chips, amounting to about .006 degrees at the corners, and
causes an error of only about 0.24 pixel if uncompensated.  
<P>

The design uses a 2.5-meter  f/2.25 primary with a 1.08-meter secondary,

which with its baffles (1.30-meter dia.) obscures 27% of the incoming 
beam.  The central hole in the primary is 1.17 meter in diameter.  Cassegrain
telescopes with fields this large are notoriously difficult to baffle,
but a variant on the "Venetian blind" baffling system used in the
DuPont design will work well here.  The optical layout and the current
baffle design is shown in Figure
<A HREF="../telescop/telescop.htm#opticalDesignFig">2.1</A>; the
rays in that figure are for an object at the extreme edge of the 3deg
field.  The output  f/ratio is 5.0, and the focal plane is 0.76 meters
behind the vertex of the primary in order to clear the cell and allow
room for the instruments.  The telescope is quite short-coupled, with
the secondary only 3.6 meters in front of the primary.  The corrector
consists of two aspheric fused quartz elements, as discussed above.  The
first (`Gascoigne') element is approximately coincident with the vertex
of the primary mirror; there will be two interchangeable rear
correctors, a very thick one associated with the camera
(and in fact an intimate
part of its mechanical design -- see Chapter <A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#camera">4</A>), and a
much thinner one for use with the spectrograph.  The top surface
of the second element in the camera configuration is just 58 mm from the
focus, and for the camera element the back surface of the filters, which
are cemented to the corrector, is 8 mm from the focus. The spectrographic
configuration has 34 mm of working space behind the second corrector.
The 3&deg; field
is 0.65 meters in diameter; over this field, the focal surface of the
camera configuration is described to reasonable accuracy as a simple
quartic in the radius; it is flat to within about  +- 0.2 mm
over the inner 0.5 m, and rises rapidly about 2 mm at the edge.
<P>

The CCDs for the imager will be mounted to conform to the focal surface,

which requires a tilt of just under a degree at the edge of the field. 
There is one further complication in the design, namely that the CCDs
as produced are slightly convex, with a reasonably well controlled radius
of about 2.2 meters. The best fit plane results in focus errors of about
100 &micro;   RMS, which at f/5 corresponds to an image degradation of about
20 &micro;. We have chosen <I>not</I> to live with this, but instead to 
correct this curvature individually for each chip with weak field
flatteners cemented to the rear face of the corrector.
This is more to attempt to keep the point
spread functions reasonably constant over a chip than a fundamental
discomfort with global focus errors this large, but we shall
see that for some chips in the array there are unavoidable significant
variations anyway.
<P>

The spectroscopic optical configuration is similar; the two share the primary,

secondary, and Gascoigne corrector, but the last corrector is
substantially different. It is much thinner (which substantially reduces
longitudinal color), quite strongly curved,
and a bit farther from the focal plane than the one for the camera.
Its design was optimized for lateral color, which is better than 4 microns
RMS over the whole field while maintaining polychromatic images better
than 1 arcsecond RMS diameter.
The primary-secondary
spacing is also slightly different; the difference is well
within the secondary focus range. The spectroscopic design
violates the `telecentric' condition that the focal plane be
perpendicular to the central ray in each image.  This means that the
fibers are not placed perpendicular to the focal plane.  We will use drilled
plug-plates for the fibers, and the most straightforward
way to deal with the lack of telecentricity, as we shall see, is to drill the
plug-plates for the fibers while the plates are deformed slightly. This
will be discussed further in Section <A HREF="../spectro/spectro.htm#plugPlates">7.6.0.1</A>.

The index for fused quartz (fq) is

<P>
The camera design is specified in Table <A HREF="../telescop/telescop.htm#opticalDesign">2.1</A>a, and 
the spectroscopic design in Table <A HREF="../telescop/telescop.htm#opticalDesign">2.1</A>b.
The primary mirror is  f/2.25, and
the overall system is  f/5.0.  In this final version, the camera design has
been optimized for the chosen distribution of filters over the focal
plane, and the details of the performance, and that of the spectroscopic
design, are discussed below.
The overall scale is
60.4 microns/arcsecond; one pixel is 0.403 arcsecond = 24 microns.  There
are a total of 6 glass-air surfaces, the pupil radius is 1250.00 mm with
a 625 mm central obscuration, taken (not quite correctly) at the primary, 
and the first conjugate is at infinity. 
<P>

The primary is almost hyperbolic, with about a wave and a half of 6th

and 8th order flattening at the edge; the secondary is likewise, with
about two waves of 6th order steepening.  For interferometric tests of
the primary, 
we used a null lens verified using a technique
developed by J. Burge (Steward Observatory Mirror Lab) which uses
a computer generated hologram.  Interferometric testing of the secondary
uses an innovative and powerful
holographic test against an almost matching sphere, also conceived by Burge.
The first corrector
plate is straightforward, and, under contract with Contraves Inc., has been
aspherized, figured and polished using a null test.
The second corrector, in imaging mode, is very strong, with an aspheric
sagitta of more than 8 millimeters, but the accuracy required is not
very high by optical standards and the surface has been monitored with
sufficient accuracy with a simple profilometer during fabrication.  The 
contract for this second corrector plate for the camera was 
completed by Loomis Custom Optics with excellent results.  
Custom Optics also drilled the camera mounting holes (see Chapter 
<A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#camera">4</A>) in the flat side of this corrector,  and
the corrector underwent application of a custom 
striped antireflection coating which matches the camera photometric bands.
The second spectrographic corrector was aspherized,
figured and polished under contract 
with Tinsley Laboratories. 
<P>

<H3>The Performance of the Imaging Design</H3>The discussion of the optical performance of the camera configuration is
a bit complicated because of the complexity of the focal plane, with
different filters and field flatteners in different locations and the
effect of distortion on the final TDI image quality, so we will approach
a full discussion gradually.  A series of simple monochromatic traces of
the camera system without the individual field flatteners is presented
in Table <A HREF="../telescop/telescop.htm#opticalDesignParamsTab">2.2</A>a.  Here the focus
(distance behind the dummy surface 8,
which is the nominal 8 mm back focal distance behind the last (filter)
element)  f<sub>b</sub> , the image height  h  at that focus, and the RMS image
diameter   epsilon   is tabulated for each of 8 field angles from the
center to the edge of the imaging field (which is somewhat smaller than
the whole spectroscopic field) for the 5 colors which are the effective
wavelengths for the five filters we propose.  The last four field angles
correspond to the outer corners of the outermost chip in some row, and
angles which are not actually reached at a given color with the camera
design (see Figure <A HREF="../telescop/telescop.htm#cameraFieldFig">2.2</A>) are prefixed with a ` * '.
The images are
degraded somewhat at the very edge, where the radial field curvature is
maximum, by the finite (flat) area of the chips, but this effect will be
evaluated in detail along with TDI and polychromatic effects below. 
<P>

The form of the focal surface at 4760&Aring; is presented next, in Table

<A HREF="../telescop/telescop.htm#opticalDesignParamsTab">2.2</A>b.    delta   is the total longitudinal
focal deviation from a plane
at the indicated angle, ht the height in the focal surface, lindev the
deviation from a best-fit straight line relating the input angle to the
height, and lin ht that linear relation.  The errors (maximum of about
4 &micro;) simply reflect the order of the fit; it is clear that the
distortion is controlled by the local slope of this surface, and can be
made to vanish (or take on any reasonable form) exactly.  The corrector
is close enough to the focus that there is little repercussion on the
image quality or the lateral color when it is modified slightly. 
<P>

To discuss the quality of the images as accurately as possible requires

a much more detailed analysis, which we summarize briefly here.
The optical layout of the camera focal plane is
sketched in Figure <A HREF="../telescop/telescop.htm#cameraFieldFig">2.2</A>, which shows the locations of the
30 2048x2048
"photometric" CCDs, the 22 2048x400 "astrometric" chips, and the two
2048x400 focus sensors.  The filters 
 u'  (  lambda<sub>eff</sub> = 3540 &Aring;), 
 g'  (  lambda<sub>eff</sub> = 4760 &Aring;),
 r'  (  lambda<sub>eff</sub> = 6280 &Aring;), 
 i'  (  lambda<sub>eff</sub> = 7690 &Aring;), and 
 z'  (  lambda<sub>eff</sub> = 9250 &Aring;), with which
each field is identified, are fully described in Chapter <A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#camera">4</A>.
(The camera
is right-left reflection symmetric and the lower astrometric/focus array
is the mirror image of the upper array).  The direction of the TDI scan
is upwards in this diagram, so a given star first encounters an
astrometric device, then an  r'  chip, then a 
 i'  chip, and so on until, 485
seconds later, it encounters the final astrometric chip.  The large
circle is the full 90.4 arcminute radius field.  Each small circle within the
CCD outlines is a point for which the system has been traced with five
wavelengths chosen such that each is the mean wavelength of the
corresponding quintile of the filter response; thus each has equal
weight in the final image.  Cemented to the flat back surface of the
final corrector is the colored glass component of the filter and to that
the field flattener, whose radius of curvature is chosen from a set of
four which spans the requirements and on whose back surface is coated
the short-pass part of the filter.  The central thickness of the
filter/flattener sandwich is constant at 5.00 mm.

The field of the SDSS Camera.  The photometric CCDs are
arranged in 6 identical columns of 5  2048x 2048  chips, each with
one of the five primary filter bands of the survey.  Leading and trailing
these columns are arrays of 12  2048x 400  chips for astrometric
calibration and focus. The fields discussed in the text are identified by
number and their corresponding filter. One stripe of the survey is 
composed of two TDI scans, one centered on the column labeled C1 through
the boresight B1, the other on the column labeled C2 through B2.<HR>

The final images (five per CCD) are composed of the five individual
monochromatic images and, because TDI integrates along a column, of the
five images along a CCD column, taking account in the first instance of
any lateral color shifts and in the second of any residual distortion
perpendicular to the column and any residual distortion and scale error
along the column.  The images are defocused to lie in the best-fitting
focal surface with the mean curvature of the CCDs for each subfield
(tilt and piston are fitted).  The input angles along the column
accurately represent images at successive equally spaced time intervals
in TDI mode, and the geometry on the sky for TDI is accurately modeled. 
The final images are shown in Figure <A HREF="../telescop/telescop.htm#psfPhotoFig">2.3</A>.  Here each row of
images is the model of TDI output for the array as labeled in
Figure <A HREF="../telescop/telescop.htm#cameraFieldFig">2.2</A>; thus the
bottom row consists of five images each across fields 13, 14, and 15,
the next 7, 8, and 9, and so forth.  The top two rows are the
astrometric fields 16, 17, 18, and 19, 20, 21.  The images for the focus
array are discussed and shown later.  The spacing between successive
closely spaced images in the mosaic is 3 arcseconds.  The bottom panel
shows the images as delivered by the design optical system; the top as
convolved with 0.8 arcsecond Gaussian seeing, which we believe will be
the worst seeing we will have to cope with in the photometric part of
the survey (see Chapter <A HREF="../strategy/strategy.htm#strategy">1</A>).  The PSFs were generated
by fitting discrete Zernike polynomials to the slope errors in the
system and using those fits to generate intercepts in the desired focal
plane for 1200 rays for each of the 25 images which go into the
polychromatic TDI composite.  Those rays were simply binned in 0.05
arcsecond pixels to generate the intensities for the greyscale images. 
<P>

The situation is summarized quantitatively in Table

<A HREF="../telescop/telescop.htm#opticalDesignParamsTab">2.2</A>c, where each row
lists the properties of one field (detector).  The identifying numbers
are as in Figure <A HREF="../telescop/telescop.htm#cameraFieldFig">2.2</A>.  The table lists for each field the
field center
in millimeters measured from the optical axis (-y is the TDI scan
direction) the size of the CCD for that field, the filter, the field
flattener curvature in units of  10<sup>-3</sup>mm<sup>-1</sup>  (ffc3), the CCD
curvature in units of  10<sup>-4</sup>mm<sup>-1</sup>  (ccd4), the vertical scale
in that field (mm/arcmin), the RMS focus error in microns over the CCD
caused by mismatch between the final best focal surface and the curved
CCD surface, the residual field curvature in units of  10<sup>-4</sup>
mm <sup>-1</sup>  (dc4), and the minimum (em) and maximum (eM) RMS image diameters over
the field in microns.  We should perhaps comment on the residual
curvature; the overall scale is as listed in
Table <A HREF="../telescop/telescop.htm#opticalDesignParamsTab">2.2</A>b, 3.623mm/arcmin,
but the field flatteners change the scale locally for each chip to a
number close to 3.6431, which was the "scan scale" -- i.e. the assumed
tracking rate.  Changes in this scale from chip to chip, and color
to color, represent errors in the TDI images, and the field flattener
curvatures are chosen for the best compromise between keeping the scale
constant and matching the focal curvature.  Scale errors are in general
much more serious for image quality than focal errors, so there is
usually some residual curvature. 
<P>

The results indicate that for the <I>photometric</I> array, the maximum

RMS image diameters are for the ultraviolet fields reaching 0.68
arcseconds for the outermost one.  The increase from 27 to 41 microns 
from the monochromatic
to the full TDI polychromatic treatment is mostly due to longitudinal
color, with tiny contributions from defocus, lateral color, and substantial
ones from
TDI effects.  Images almost as large are seen at the field extremes 
at the other end of the spectrum in  z' , where they reach 39 microns,
0.65 arcsec RMS.  
The other images are of order 0.5 arcsec or better over the whole field.
The problems in  z'  are just due to the extreme
wavelength; the optimization of the system involves balancing the color
effects at the wavelength extremes, and because the polychromatic effects
at  u'  are so large the optimization was `tilted' toward the
ultraviolet.
<P>

The images for the <I>astrometric</I> chips are almost as good except for the 

outer half of field 18, the outermost of the second rank of CCDs, where
the images reach two-thirds of an arcsecond in RMS diameter.
<P>

Recall for all of these results that for a roughly gaussian image, the

RMS diameter is 1.20 times the FWHM, so by that measure the images are
correspondingly better.
<P>

The images for the focus chips (field 22) are quite good, about 0.38

arcsecond RMS diameter, and with almost no variation over the field, so
even though the focus sensors (see Chapter <A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#camera">4</A> for a 
fuller discussion of
the focusing scheme and illustrations of the focus chip images through
focus) are near the outer edge of the field, there is no compromise in
image quality for them. The fact that the dominant residual aberration
at this point is third-order astigmatism means that the out-of-focus
images are decidedly elliptical and this can be used to refine the
focus servo.

<H3>The Performance of the Spectrographic Design</H3><P>

In Table <A HREF="../telescop/telescop.htm#spectroPerformanceTab">2.3</A> data are presented which are relevant

to the spectrographic
mode.  At each of seven field angles from the center to the extreme
edge, the focal properties are given on a surface which represents the
average focal surface over the spectrograph wavelength range of 3900
&Aring; to 9200 &Aring; (the spectrograph is described fully in Chapter
<A HREF="../spectro/spectro.htm#spectrographs">7</A>). 
The first set of entries is for 5300 &Aring;, which roughly centers the
range of index variations for the spectrograph.  The height differences
(in the sense of the height at the given wavelength minus the height at
5300 &Aring;, which are tabulated after the 5300 &Aring; entries), thus
represent lateral color, which is seen to be 10 microns total,  +-
5  microns, or less over the whole field, and are even somewhat smaller at the
edges where the images are larger.  The  D s are longitudinal
deviations from best focus at that wavelength, and the   epsilon  s are
RMS image diameters at the compromise focus.  It is only at the
wavelength extremes and at the extreme edge of the field that the
RMS diameters of the compromise images exceed 1 arcsecond; the best focus images
there are substantially less than 1 arcsecond (45 and 40 microns at
4000&Aring; and 9000&Aring;, respectively, at 90 arcminutes radius), and the
increase is due solely to longitudinal color.  The 72 micron worst-case
RMS diameter is still much smaller than the 180 micron fibers, however,
and the effect on throughput is not large; we discuss the issue more
fully below.  The details of the average focal surface are presented
next: the sagitta of the focal surface, the mean height (here just the
average of the 4000 &Aring; height and the 9000 &Aring; one, and presumably
where one will drill the fiber hole), the deviation from a linear
relation with the field angle (it is seen here that the different final
corrector form, chosen to yield the best polychromatic images, results
in quite serious distortion, but this is of no importance for the
spectrograph), the direction cosine of the central ray measured from the
direction of the axis, and the <I>difference</I> between this angle and
the angle which the normal to the focal surface makes with the axis.
This last entry is the angle with which the fiber hole must be drilled
into a plate which conforms to the focal surface.
The maximum value is about 2.0
degrees, compared to the 5.7 degree half-angle input cone at  f/5.  The
losses, even into the  f/4 input beam of the spectrograph, are large
enough to be important, and we will compensate for it by drilling the
holes into a deformed plate, as will be discussed in detail in Chapter
<A HREF="../spectro/spectro.htm#spectrographs">7</A>.
<P>

As will be discussed further in Chapter <A HREF="../strategy/strategy.htm#strategy">1</A>,

we expect to use the best-seeing time for imaging and do fiber
spectroscopy under less-good conditions; average seeing for the latter
will probably be in the range 1.2-1.5 arcseconds.  Differential
refraction at the ends of the spectrum at the maximum zenith angle (55
degrees) is just under  +- 1  arcsecond from the central wavelength
image at the altitude of the site.  With 1.5-arcsecond Gaussian seeing,
a 3-arcsecond fiber at the field edge collects 95% and 92% of the
light at 4000 &Aring; and 9000 &Aring;, respectively, when centered on the
image, and at worst 65% and 67% when decentered by 1 arcsecond.  This
is not substantially worse than the situation in the center of the field
at the central wavelength, where the centered number is 98% and the
1-arcsecond offset number is 72%.  For extended objects, we collect a
smaller fraction of the light, of course, but the <I>differential</I>
between the center and edge is smaller. 
<P>

Greyscale PSFs for the field angles in the table are shown in Figure

<A HREF="../telescop/telescop.htm#psfSpectroFig">2.4</A>,
and convolved with 1.5 arcsecond Gaussian
seeing; the images are 6 arcseconds apart in the mosaic, and the circles 
are three arcseconds in diameter, the input diameter of the fibers.
<P>

<H2>Mechanical Design and Performance</H2><P>

<H3>General Considerations</H3><P>

The telescope is an altitude-azimuth design similar to the Apache

Point Observatory (APO) and Wisconsin, Indiana, Yale, NOAO (WIYN) 3.5
m telescopes. (Mannery et al. 1986a,b, Gunnels 1990a, Johns and Pilachowski
1990).  This design takes full advantage of
lightweight mirror technology resulting in a telescope with low
inertia, low friction, and mechanical simplicity.
<P>

We have elected both for cost reasons and for thermal performance to use

a roll-away enclosure. The telescope is protected from the wind and
stray light by means of an independently mounted and driven baffle which
is coaxial with and encloses the telescope. 
<P>

<H3>Structure</H3>The telescope optics support structure (OSS) consists of the primary
support structure (PSS) and the secondary truss (Figure <A HREF="../telescop/telescop.htm#telescopeFig">2.5</A>). 
The PSS is a steel weldment that supports the primary mirror and couples
the OSS to the fork.  The one-piece construction of the PSS has a higher
stiffness to weight ratio and is lower in cost than the more traditional
detachable mirror cell.  The secondary space truss controls five of
the degrees of freedom of the secondary mirror directly.  With
adequate tension in the secondary vanes, the rotation mode of the
secondary about its optical axis can be kept above 10 Hz.  The square
secondary frame is efficient at resisting this tension.
<P>

<HR>
<H4><A NAME="telescopeFig">Figure 2.5</A></H4>
<IMG ALIGN="MIDDLE" ALT="telescop.gif" SRC="../telescop/telescop.gif"><P>
Two views of the 2.5-meter telescope. The mechanical
design is essentially a scaled version of the WIYN 3.5-m instrument. The
wind baffle and the light baffles are shown in relation to rays from the
edge of the 3&deg; field of view.
<HR>
<P>

The eight metering elements of the secondary truss are graphite 

fiber reinforced epoxy tubes.  This material has about 2.3
times the stiffness to mass ratio of steel.  This confers the
following benefits:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>A substantial amount of mass is removed from the truss without
degrading its static deflection or lowest natural frequency.  

<LI>The reduced moment of inertia reduces the susceptibility of the
telescope to wind-induced tracking errors.

<LI>The diameters of the truss elements are reduced without lowering
their natural frequency. This, in turn, decreases the wind loads on the
truss.

<LI>The reduced mass of the truss moves the center of gravity of the OSS
forward.  This allows the altitude bearings to be located lower on the OSS
and increased the clearance for instruments mounted behind the PSS. 
</UL>

Tubes and other linear structural shapes of graphite fiber reinforced 
epoxy have a much lower coefficient of thermal expansion than steel in 
the long direction.  Thus, another benefit is improved metering of 
the primary/secondary separation with temperature changes.
<P>

<H3>Bearings and Drives</H3><P>

The moving mass of the SDSS 2.5-m telescope is 15,500 kg, which is

light enough that exotic bearing technology is hardly required. We
have chosen to use precision rolling-element bearings and friction drives
throughout. These elements have all been manufactured and installed
at the site and we have
reasonably reliable measurements of the errors associated with
their manufacture.
<P>

A pair of 2.54 meter diameter, hardened and ground drive segments are

mounted on the sides of the PSS next to the fork. The measured high 
frequency (greater than eight cycles/revolution) runout of the drive 
segments is less than 100 nm RMS.  Motor driven capstans, friction-coupled 
to each disk, provide balanced altitude drive torques and minimize windup 
of the PSS (Gunnels, 1990b).
<P>

The telescope azimuth structure consists of the fork and the azimuth

cone.  At the apex of the azimuth cone is a spherical roller bearing
that supports the weight of the telescope.  At the upper end of the cone
is a 2.54 meter diameter disk, with a hardened and ground outer surface.
Its high frequency runout is 220 nm RMS. This disk is guided by four
roller assemblies, two of which are motor driven.  These rollers, with 
the bearing at the cone apex, define the telescope
azimuth axis.  
<P>

Incremental encoders are friction coupled to the large disks. Readily

available encoders (ROD 800, Heidenhain Corp., Elk Grove Village,
Illinois) with a reduction ratio of 25:1 give 3.6
milliarcsecond resolution on the sky and allow slew rates higher than
4 &deg;/s.  Absolute axis encoding is provided by magnesensors (Sony
Corporation, Park Ridge, New Jersey).  These devices detect the position of
magnets mounted to the drive disks and generate a signal repeatable to
about 1 micron or better than 0.2" on the sky.  Each axis is
controlled by a third order dc position control system (Schier, 1990).
<P>

We have measured the dynamic performance of the APO 3.5-m telescope

and find that the telescope is quite stiff with locked rotor resonance
frequencies (the natural frequency of the telescope about an axis with
the drive motor shafts locked) of 7.8 and 11.7 Hz for the azimuth and
altitude axes respectively.  Scaling laws indicate that a similar 2.5-m
telescope should have 40% higher frequencies.
<P>

Rolling element bearings are used for each axis.  These bearings require

little maintenance, are low in friction, and generate negligible heat
during operation.  The measured high frequency radial run-out of the 
spherical roller bearing used as the lower azimuth bearing for the SDSS 
2.5-m telescope is less than 310 nm RMS. This corresponds to a contribution 
of 23 milliarcsecond to the RMS tracking error for the telescope. The high 
frequency radial run-out of the altitude bearings is 51 nm RMS. They are 
estimated to contribute less than 6 milliarcsecond RMS tracking error.
<P>

<H3>Optics: Support and Thermal control</H3><P>

The mirror is a borosilicate honeycomb (Figure <A HREF="../telescop/telescop.htm#primaryFig">2.6</A>)

and was cast by
Hextek Corporation (Tucson) in July 1992.  The casting technique is
similar to that developed at the University of Arizona Mirror Lab,
except that the furnace is not rotated.  The first casting attempt failed
during annealing and cracks were found in the blank when the oven was
opened. The causes of the failure were identified and corrected and the
mirror was reheated in January.  After a successful anneal, the blank was
cleaned and inspected and found to be of excellent quality with low
residual stresses.  The Optical Sciences Center at the University of
Arizona generated, figured and polished the mirror, which was delivered,
aluminized, to APO in July 1996.
<P>

The primary mirror is supported on air pistons using elastomeric,

low-friction rolling seals for both axial and transverse supports. 
Three stiff load cells serve as axial hard-points.  Simple servo systems
act to control the pressure provided to those air pistons in the
120&deg; sector associated with each load cell so that the
unsupported mirror weight applied to the load cell is less than 10 N. 
Each axial hard-point is positioned axially with a motor driven lead screw.
 This allows control of primary
piston and tilt.  
<P>

As the telescope changes elevation from zenith to

horizon, the secondary will sag about 500 microns with respect to the
primary optical axis.  This decollimation is corrected by actively 
translating the secondary so that its vertex remains on the optical axis 
of the
primary and correcting the tilt of the secondary as necessary. 
<P>

<HR>
<H4><A NAME="primaryFig">Figure 2.6</A></H4>
<IMG ALIGN="MIDDLE" ALT="primary.gif" SRC="../telescop/primary.gif"><P>
Primary mirror at the Optical Sciences Center.  The mirror was
cast of Ohara E6 borosilicate glass by the Hextek Corporation.
<HR>
<P>

We will be using aluminum plug-plates to position the optical

fibers for the multifiber spectrograph.  The plates will be drilled
for the predicted temperature of use.  However, just before use, the
image scale will have to be matched to the fibers.  This will be done
by translating the primary axially and refocusing the secondary.  A
10&deg;C temperature mismatch can be corrected by translations of 2.4
mm and 2.0 mm for the primary and secondary respectively.
<P>

The borosilicate glass used in the primary mirror is a low thermal

expansion material with an expansion coefficient of 
 2.8 x
10<sup>-6</sup>/&deg;C . To prevent thermal distortion of the mirror and mirror
seeing from significantly degrading image quality, the temperature of
the mirror must be uniform to 0.2&deg;C. (This figure is larger than that
established for other telescope using similar mirrors because the
resolution of this wide-field optical system is moderate, though adequate
to the task.) 
<P>

Several active temperature control systems have been developed to perform

these tasks (Johns and Pilachowski 1990; Siegmund et al. 1990; Lloyd-Hart
1990).  We plan to use the rather simple system that is implemented
on the ARC 3.5-m mirror. Extensive instrumentation of this mirror 
and balancing of the ventilation system has demonstrated that the
performance of this system will be more than adequate for the 2.5-m telescope
optics.
<P>

The secondary mirror is supported by three whiffletrees.  Each whiffletree

is positioned by an axial lead screw driven by a stepper motor via a
harmonic drive.  This provides control of mirror piston and tilt.  The
axial step size is 53 nm.  This gives a resolution of 7.8 milliarcseconds
on the focal plane.  The lead screw/bearing assembly is specified to have
an accuracy of 250 nm. The performance of these actuators on the 
3.5-m telescope secondary has been measured. The differential motion 
across the diameter of the mirror is 310 nm RMS. This amounts to 57 mas 
RMS 2-dimensional motion on the sky for the 2.5-m. We expect that much 
smoother motions, albeit over a smaller range, can be obtained with 
piezo-electric actuators. These will be mounted in series with the lead 
screw actuators and used to correct focus during imaging.  Similar drives 
would do nicely  to control primary piston and tilt, although it is not 
yet clear that such high precision will be necessary for that mirror.
<P>

The secondary mirror is a borosilicate hot gas fusion blank manufactured by

Hextek Corporation. The temperature control requirement to avoid degrading
image quality corresponds to a uniformity of 0.2&deg;C. The mass of the
secondary is 10% of the primary, and the ventilation flow rate and heat
transfer rates are reduced by the same factor. The need to bring cooling
fluid to the secondary can be avoided by radiating the excess heat to the
sky.
<P>

We plan to install in the primary and secondary mirrors a temperature

measurement system that we have developed for the 3.5-m telescope to debug
mirror temperature control systems. This system uses integrated circuit
temperature sensors (Analog Devices AD590) to measure temperatures at one
to two hundred locations throughout the mirror.  These data are used to
adjust flow rates of ventilating air to equalize thermal time constants
throughout the mirror.  The system, being tested on the 3.5-m mirror, has
an accuracy of better than 1&deg;C, a resolution of 5 m&deg;C, and a
calibration drift rate of 14 m&deg;C/month RMS. 
<P>

Temperature changes and, most dramatically, temperature differences between

the face and back plate of a mirror, affect its power. This causes a scale
change at the telescope focus and contributes to astrometric error, if not
corrected in the analysis of the image data. The temperature measurement
system described above will monitor changes in the power of the optics and
allow the necessary corrections to be made.
<P>

<H3>The Instrument Rotator</H3><P>

A large diameter instrument rotator covers the back of the

mirror cell.  The spectrographs, camera and fiber plug-plate cartridges
will mount to this rotator.  Since the spectrographs will corotate
with the plug-plates, this eliminates most of the flexing of the
fibers that might occur during an integration and should allow for
better sky subtraction. Also, as the fibers will be less than 2 meters long, 
additional benefits include reduction of light loss and materials cost.
<P>

The angular accuracy required for the rotator is reduced from that needed

for the axes by the ratio of the telescope focal length to the field
radius, a factor of 34.  This degree of accuracy is quite straightforward
to achieve, but is by no means a negligible task. The bearing is a Rotek 
four-point contact ball bearing. Its high frequency (greater than eight 
cycles/revolution) lateral runout was measured at about 170 nm RMS per 
axis at an altitude of 0&deg;. The encoder and friction drive for the 
rotator are similar to those used for the axes. The drive disk for the 
rotator is about 2.80 meters in diameter and its high frequency runout 
is 1.0 &micro;m RMS.
<P>

It is necessary, in order to control the image scale of the telescope, to

monitor the distance from the focal plane to the vertex of the primary
mirror very accurately (25 microns) .  The load path connecting
these locations is very stiff and we are likely to have excellent control
of the temperature of this material as part of the primary mirror
temperature control system.
<P>

<H3>Light Baffles</H3><P>

The roll-off enclosure for the telescope is very compact and has a low

cross-section for wind loading, both of which reduce the mass and cost of
the enclosure base.  However, it leaves the telescope completely exposed to
the wind and to light sources.  These problems are addressed by the wind
baffle that closely surrounds the telescope but has a separate
low-precision drive system and transfers wind loads to the stationary
portion of the telescope building.  The wind baffle has a square
cross-section that fits closely around the square secondary frame of the
telescope. 
<P>

The sides of the wind baffle, fabricated under contract with 

CVE Machining, are covered with wind-permeable panels.  The
panels (H. H. Robertson model 5100), with 25% equivalent open area,
consist of interlocking "C"
cross-section elements.  Light paths through the panel require scattering
from a minimum of two surfaces. Thus, with suitable coatings, the panel can
be made quite light opaque.
<P>

The sky-facing end of the wind baffle contains an annular opening formed by

a central disk and a panel with a circular opening (both supported by the
wind baffle frame).  This opening provides clearance for light from the
3&deg; field of view to reach the telescope entrance pupil. The wind baffle 
blocks light rays that would otherwise have to be
intercepted by the other baffles and prevents direct illumination of the
primary mirror by sources more than
27&deg; from the boresight (Figure <A HREF="../telescop/telescop.htm#opticalDesignFig">2.1</A>).  
<P>

The inner baffles consist of the secondary baffle (in front of the

secondary), the primary baffle (extending through the primary center hole),
and the conical baffle (suspended between the primary and secondary). 
The conical baffle is not usually present in a two mirror telescope
design. It is necessary here to avoid unacceptably large central
obscuration that would otherwise be the consequence of this wide field
optical design.  The design shown has a central obscuration of 27%.  The
conical baffle adds an additional 2%.
<P>

We have contracted for an analysis of the baffle design using the

Advanced System Analysis Package (ASAP).  Preliminary designs have been
analyzed using this code and indicate quite satisfactory performance,
and we expect that this design will achieve over the whole range of
incidence angles greater than about 30&deg; off axis ratios of incident
flux to flux in the focal plane (PSNIT) better than  2x 10<sup>-6</sup> . 
This translates, for example, to a scattering contribution to the night
sky in the focal plane of about 26.0 mag/arsec <sup>2</sup> by a quarter moon 40
degrees off axis.  This is 2% of the <I>dark</I> night sky, and less than
half a percent of the moonlit night sky.  The ASAP software is being
used for the scattered light analysis of many other projects, including
the Near IR Camera Multiobject Spectrograph (NICMOS), a second
generation Hubble Space Telescope instrument. 
<P>

<H3>Wind Baffle Design</H3><P>

The sides of the wind baffle are covered with panels that are 25% porous

to the wind.  Water tunnel studies indicate that with this porosity, the
flow speed around the telescope secondary is reduced to about 1/3 of the
free stream flow speed while the flushing time for fluid inside the baffle
is still a very rapid 15 to 30 seconds.   Water tunnel studies show that
flow passing through the channels in the panel diffuses rapidly, i.e., on
scales of 0.1 m. No spatially persistent high-velocity
jets that might cause wind-induced tracking error are observed.
<P>

Centered on the telescope azimuth axis and flush with the telescope

enclosure floor and the top of the telescope fork base is a motor-driven 
circular floor panel that follows the motions of the azimuth axis of 
the telescope.  It
supports the wind baffle altitude drive, drives it in azimuth and provides
rotating floor space around the telescope for the storage of the camera
when a fiber optic cartridge is on the telescope.
<P>

Traditional telescope enclosures act as cavity radiators. The net radiation

imbalance with a clear sky is roughly 100 watts/m <sup>2</sup> of horizontal
projected area. In a well-designed telescope enclosure with low thermal
inertia and minimal heat sources, this power (kilowatts for a typical slit
size) comes from conduction from the air within the telescope chamber,
i.e., via the production of colder than ambient air. This cold air can
cause image degradation should it enter the telescope light path.
<P>

The wind baffle reduces radiative coupling of the telescope OSS to the sky

by minimizing the area of the opening at the end of the telescope. The
outer surfaces of the wind baffle are covered with low emissivity
aluminum foil tape.  Wind baffle surfaces that are well coupled to the sky
but which must be black in the visible to absorb scattered light are
covered with black chrome tape, a selective emitter with high emissivity in
the visible and near IR and low emissivity in the thermal
IR. This solution does not work inside the wind baffle since the surface
emissivity would have to be nearly zero to reduce the emissivity observed
through the opening into a cavity. However, the wind baffle is small enough
(unlike a conventional telescope enclosure) that it is practical to
circulate fluid through pipes thermally coupled to the wind baffle panels.
The temperature of the fluid will be controlled to be the same as the
ambient air temperature. Approximately 350 watts of heat will be required.
<P>

The control system for each of the two axes of the wind baffle is similar

to the control system for the APO 3.5-m telescope enclosure.  In this
system, a velocity feed-forward signal is obtained from the azimuth axis
tachometer.  A linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) is mounted
so as to produce a signal proportional to the difference in azimuth of the
enclosure and telescope.  These signals control two dc motors that drive
two of the four wheels that support the 100 ton rotating telescope
enclosure.  Each motor is driven by a separate velocity servo that is
closed about a tachometer on the motor shaft.  With this system it has been
straightforward to control the telescope enclosure orientation to 1
milliradian or better.
<P>

<H3>Tracking</H3><P>

The wind baffle reduces wind loading on the telescope OSS by a factor of

ten. With care taken in the design of drive and encoding systems, bearings,
and the structure, the result should be a telescope with very low
wind-induced tracking error that performs at the level necessary to achieve
our goals for astrometric accuracy.  
<P>

Figure <A HREF="../telescop/telescop.htm#trackingErrorFig">2.7</A> demonstrates that this level of performance

is feasible. These
data were obtained on the ARC 3.5m from an intensified CCD camera
sampling at intervals of 
about 13 seconds and integrating for about 1 second while the telescope was
tracking open loop.  Wind speed was low and the telescope was pointed
southeast at an elevation of 60&deg;.  These data are uncorrected for
seeing effects but are from a 5 minute interval during which the tracking
was particularly smooth. The error about a linear drift is better than 100
mas peak-to-peak.
<P>

Wind-induced tracking error scales as L <sup>2/3</sup> , where L is a typical scale

length (Ulich 1988). Thus, the 2.5-m telescope, which is similar in
topology to the 3.5-m telescope, should be about 20% less susceptible to
wind-induced tracking error.  The use of graphite fiber reinforced epoxy in
the secondary truss should result in an additional improvement of similar 
magnitude.

<H2>The Enclosure</H2><P>

During spectroscopic observations, it will be necessary to change

plug-plates cartridges about once per hour, and the plug-plate cartridges
are expected to have a mass of about 100 kg.  For this, and other reasons,
the telescope is mounted so that we have access to it via
a level track, but still have sufficient ground clearance not to degrade
the seeing.

The 2.5-m telescope as installed in October, 1995. Centered on the 
telescope azimuth axis is a circular floor panel that rotates with the 
telescope. Access to the telescope is along a horizontal ramp from the 
support building
through the telescope enclosure (at the right edge of the photo) which 
is in its open position.<HR>
<! >
The telescope site is about 90 meters (300 feet) south of the
existing 3.5-m telescope enclosure at the Apache Point Observatory,
about 20 meters (70 feet) west-southwest of the ridge top,
i.e. in the prevailing upwind direction, and allows the telescope to
be located at the same level as the ridge top and still be above the
trees, 9 to 12 meters high (see Figure <A HREF="../telescop/telescop.htm#buildingFig">2.8</A>).
The support building on the ridge top, near the telescope, will be used
for plate
plugging and the storage of plug-plate cartridges.  With the support
building level with the telescope, plug-plate cartridges can be wheeled
easily between the support building and the telescope.

Perspective view of the telescope and enclosure with

<HR>
<P>

The telescope enclosure is a roll-away rectangular frame structure mounted

on wheels, and is shown in a perspective drawing in
Figure <A HREF="../telescop/telescop.htm#perspectiveFig">2.9</A>. During
observations, it is
rolled downwind from the telescope to the top of the ridge.  Large doors
on either end of the enclosure are opened during this operation to
prevent interference with the telescope and to reduce the wind-load in
the direction of motion. 
<P>

The roll-off approach has several advantages. The thermal ones

have been recognized for some time. There
are, of course, associated difficulties, particularly wind loading
and stray light as discussed above, but for our application the
advantages seem compelling
enough to compensate for the problems of operating the telescope in
the open, to wit:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>The telescope enclosure is considerably smaller and less
expensive at $570k than a conventional enclosure since it does not need to
accommodate the entire volume swept out by the telescope. 

<LI>The telescope enclosure wake is minimal, especially when open. It is
important to avoid buildings with large wakes at sites (like APO) with
other telescopes, since air overcooled by conduction to the ground is
transported throughout the wake volume by turbulence. If the light path to a
telescope passes through such a wake, image quality degradation will
result. 

<LI>Commercially available bridge crane end trucks and electrical
cable reel systems provide the transport system
and power for the telescope enclosure.  The doors at the ends of the
enclosure are commercially available, as well.  For conventional
enclosures, the enclosure rotation and shutter drive systems are
special designs.

<LI>When realuminization of the primary mirror is required, a hoist
mounted to the ridge beam serves to lift the primary mirror out of the
telescope.  The enclosure is used to transport the mirror over the bed
of a truck waiting at the ridge top.  This eliminates the need to
provide a large pathway for the primary mirror within the structure of
a conventional enclosure.

<LI>Traditional dome-induced seeing is eliminated.  Sources of
heat, radiative cooling, and thermal inertia are reduced and the
flushing of the volume surrounding the telescope is improved.

<LI>The tallest trees at the site are located just below the ridge
top and near the proposed site.  If the telescope were placed at the
ridge top, it would be downwind of these trees and the turbulence they
produce.

<LI>With the enclosure track built up the slope, only the columns
near the telescope need be long.  Much of the track is near ground
level, allowing better access for maintenance.
</UL>

Personnel safety is assured by allowing control of the enclosure motions

only from a location that provides a good view of the operation.  The
perimeter of the platform surrounding the telescope is protected by a
railing.  The outdoor portion of the deck is covered with galvanized
steel grating to provide personnel safety but minimize snow buildup.
<P>

The design provides several options for handling drive system

failures.  Power to the building is backed up by an emergency generator.
The telescope and wind baffle drive systems allow them to be moved with
hand-operated winches into an orientation allowing the enclosure to be
closed.  The force required to move the enclosure (with the doors open)
directly into a 25 m/s (55 mph) wind is 7000 N (1500 lbs). As a back up,
this force is supplied by a pair of electric wire rope winches powered by a
small general purpose gasoline generator.
