<TITLE>Site</TITLE><H1><A NAME="site">Site</A></H1><H2>General Considerations</H2><P>

We propose to conduct the survey at the Apache Point Observatory

(APO) on Sacramento Peak in New Mexico, a site which meets all
of the requirements and most of the desiderata of the SDSS.  The site
is on the continental U.S., is well-developed and is readily accessible.
The weather, seeing and sky brightness at this site are excellent, as
necessary for the successful conduct of the SDSS in our lifetimes.
Three of the SDSS institutions (Chicago, Princeton and Washington)
have been involved, through their membership in the Astrophysical
Research Consortium (ARC), in the development of this site, which has
already in place the support infrastructure needed to run the survey
and has a Forest-Service approved place to build the 2.5 m telescope.
<P>

Several major redshift surveys, including the SDSS, are currently

planned or are underway.  Most of
these are to be conducted in the Southern hemisphere, and the comparison
of the results of these surveys with those of the Northern hemisphere
SDSS will greatly enhance the value of both sets of surveys.  There
are at present no ongoing or planned redshift surveys in the Northern
hemisphere which are at all comparable with the SDSS in terms of angular
coverage or number of redshifts to be obtained.
<P>

The technological challenge of the camera and the data system, and the

drilling of the spectroscopic fiber plug plates, all mandate location
of the SDSS at a site easily accessible for the member institutions.
Location of the survey at APO makes it logistically possible to
carry out the major part of the data reduction at Fermilab.  We also hope to be able to handle the
transfer of data products to the SDSS member institutions  over the
Internet or its successor by the time the survey is underway, and this
may not be possible from a more remote site.

<H2>Location and Topography</H2><P>

<HR>
<H4><A NAME="APOSiteFig">Figure 3.1</A></H4>
<IMG ALIGN="MIDDLE" ALT="map.gif" SRC="../site/map.gif"><P>
Contour map of the site. The Apache Point area
and the Sacramento Peak Solar Observatory are shown.<HR>
<P>

The APO site lies in the Sacramento Mountains of south-central New

Mexico within the Lincoln National Forest, and is about half a mile
south of the Sacramento Peak station of the National Solar Observatory.
The latitude and longitude are
 32&deg; 46' 50" N, and
 105&deg; 49' 12" W, and the elevation is about 9180
feet (2800 meters).
A map of the site area is shown in Figure <A HREF="../site/site.htm#APOSiteFig">3.1</A>, and
includes the locations of the Cosmic Ray Site, the National
Solar Observatory, and the roads in the area.
APO is located on a promontory which projects westward from the main
ridgeline.
<P>

The summit area itself is fairly flat, gently sloping, and

lightly wooded.
<P>

Since the main ridgeline is the western boundary of

the Sacramento Mountains, only low foothills lie
between Apache Point and the Tularosa Basin, 10 km to the
west.
<P>

The prevailing

winds for most of the year encounter the Apache Point Site as the first
obstacle, and there are thus no upwind sources of turbulence or warm air.
The turbulent boundary layer is locally quite thin.
<P>

Access to the observatory site is necessarily from the

east since deep and steep-walled canyons bound the promontory in the
other directions. An 1800-meter paved road connecting to State Highway
6563 has been in place for several years to provide access to the ARC
3.5 m telescope.
<P>

<H2>Site Development</H2><P>

Early planning by the Astrophysical Research Consortium, in consultation

with the U.S. Forest Service, allocated two sites for major telescopes at
Apache Point in addition to the 3.5-m site, where development
is complete.  The Board of the Astrophysical Research Consortium has
undertaken the management of the construction phase at Apache
Point for the SDSS, and the subsequent
conduct of the SDSS, using one of these two sites.
<P>

In addition to the telescope itself, there is SDSS supporting construction

needed at the site, but ample space for these associated activities
is available.  Consequently, in August 1992, after soliciting proposals
from a number of highly qualified design firms, M3 Engineering and
Technology of Tucson, Arizona was selected to provide design services for the
necessary new developments at the site to accommodate the SDSS.  M3
Engineering has extensive experience in the design of astronomical
observatories in the southwestern United States and completed the design
for the new survey facilities in February 1993.  Construction
was completed that same year.
<P>

The development for the 3.5-m site includes the telescope enclosure, an

operations building, a utility building and a dormitory
(Figure <A HREF="../site/site.htm#buildingsFig">3.2</A>).  The
operations building contains 350 m&sup2  (3700 ft&sup2 ) of floor area and
includes a computer room, electronics shop, darkroom, kitchen, lounge and
library.  The SDSS will be able to share many of these facilities.
In particular,
the present computer room contains adequate space for the needs of
both telescopes.
About 132 m&sup2  (1424  ft&sup2 ) of floor area was added to the operations
building.  The existing library and electronics shop were moved to this
addition.
The space thereby vacated will be used in support of the survey
as a control room and workshop.  Also, three new offices were added for
survey personnel and the original darkroom was remodeled for use as a clean
room for servicing the CCD camera.

telescope building, the plugging support building (all shown cross-hatched)
and operations building (new addition shown cross-hatched) are shown.
The new dormitory building (cross-hatched) is at the upper left.<HR>
<P>

The utility building contains a two-car garage and a 50 m&sup2  (500

ft&sup2 ) machine shop.
<P>

The original dormitory consists of three

motel-type rooms, each with two beds.  A second dormitory was added about
30 meters east of the existing dormitory, and contains six
single rooms and a kitchen.
<P>

The 2.5-m telescope is located about 90 meters (300 feet) south of the

3.5-m telescope enclosure.  The site is 20 meters (70 feet)
west-southwest of the ridge top. The 2.5-m support
building is near the telescope just beyond the open position
of the telescope enclosure.  Its main function is to provide a space
for the plugging of plug-plates and for the storage of plug-plate
cartridges in the plugging queue or the telescope queue.  Inevitably,
some telescope and instrument maintenance will occur in the support
building because of its proximity to the telescope.  
<P>

Near the 2.5-m support building is the Monitor Telescope enclosure

(see Chapter <A HREF="../photcal/photcal.htm#photcal">5</A>). Since this telescope does not
require excellent image quality, it is located near
the support building for maximum convenience and sheltered in a
small commercial dome.
<P>

A driveway links the 2.5-m telescope with the rest of the site.  It is

used to deliver the plug-plates to the support building, to supply
consumables and for the occasional removal of the primary mirror for
realuminization.  This driveway is not paved so that the heat storage
and absorption characteristics of the soil near the telescope are not
degraded.  Sidewalks connect the support building to the operations
building and the lower parking lot, and provide access for people and
wheeled carts.
<P>

As part of the same construction contract, a 1.0-m telescope enclosure was

built for New Mexico State University (NMSU). Under an agreement with
NMSU, ARC is providing a telescope site and some services and facilities to
NMSU. The terms of the agreement provide that NMSU pay its share of all
costs associated with construction and operation of the telescope and that
management and funding is independent of ARC.  The 1.0-m telescope site is
located between the 3.5-m and monitor telescope sites. A 30
meter high tower which supports microthermal sensors and wind speed
and direction indicators is located 60 meters (200 feet) south
of the support building.
<P>

We have not made significant changes or additions to the

other infrastructure at the site.  These facilities include a 185 kVA
emergency power backup generator and a 20,000 gallon water storage tank and
500 gpm pump for fire protection. Electrical power comes to the site via
overhead 3-phase conductors with a
grounded counterpoise for lightning protection.  These conductors are
owned and maintained by Otero County Electrical Cooperative.  Domestic
water is supplied to the site from wells belonging to the National Solar
Observatory (NSO), for which ARC is charged at local Cloudcroft rates.
<P>

US West provides 25 phone lines to the site.  We currently 

have four voice lines for general
communications, one line dedicated to FAX service, two lines dedicated to
modem use, and 1 circuit dedicated to a leased T1 (1.544 Mbit/second)
line to Las Cruces, New Mexico for Internet access. These lines come
from a microwave tower through NSO to APO, at APO expense.
White Sands Missile Range
has 1 voice circuit and 4 data circuits. There are three new circuits
currently awaiting
installation.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="APOWeather">Weather and Sky Brightness</A></H2><P>

The Apache Point climate is relatively mild, particularly considering its

2800 meter elevation.  Winds strong enough to interfere with normal
observatory operations are relatively rare and are, in any case, often
associated with thunderstorms.  Rarely should access to the observatory
site be impaired by heavy snowfall.
<P>

The weather patterns at APO are similar to those at Kitt Peak, though

the summer `monsoon' is not quite so severe.  At KPNO, from 1966 through
1986 67% of the nights were useful, and perhaps about half of these
were photometric.  Similar statistics apply to Apache Point.
These statistics confirm the results of other studies of cloud
cover made over the past
30 years.
<P>

Over a year, 70% of the night time is clear, best in

October-November ( &gt;85 %) and worst in July-August (50-60%).  The percentage
of nights that remain perfectly cloudless and photometric throughout
the night averages about 35% (50% in October-November,
 &lt;19%  in July-August).  These numbers are comparable to or better than
optical sites at Mt. Hamilton, Mt. Palomar, Mt. Wilson (California),
Kitt Peak (Arizona), and Mt. Locke (Texas) (Smith and Salisbury 1962).
<P>

The precipitable water vapor should be as low as possible because

of the effect of water absorption on  i' - and  z' -band photometry
and spectrophotometry near the long-wavelength limit of the
spectrographs.  This quantity
ranges from less than 2 mm to 5 mm seasonally,
and is as low as any major continental observing site except Mt. Lemmon
(Arizona), as would be expected at an altitude of
2800 meters.

minutes apart by the 10 &micro;m 
cloud scanner.  The cloud motion from WSW can be
seen.  The brightest feature, above and to the right of center, is the Sun.<HR>
<P>

Since early 1994, an imaging cloud scanner (Hull et al. 1995) has

been in operation at the site to provide rapid, reliable, quantitative
measures of cloud cover.  This scanner uses a liquid-nitrogen cooled
HgCdTe infrared detector which maps the sky over a  135&deg;x135&deg;
area centered on the zenith every ten minutes with an angular
resolution of  0.9&deg;.
The scanner operates at 10 &micro;m  and is
highly sensitive to emission from clouds. An
example of four daytime images is shown in Figure <A HREF="../site/site.htm#APOClouds">3.3</A>.
The cloud motion can be seen, as can the scattering of sunlight, which
enlarges the solar image, as clouds cross the Sun.  The emission
measured by the cloud scanner can now be accessed by the Monitor Telescope
data reduction software (see Chapter <A HREF="../photcal/photcal.htm#photcal">5</A>).  Data are now
being gathered for a study of the correlation between atmospheric
extinction measured by the MT and 10 &micro;m  emission measured by
the cloud scanner.
<P>

The average visual sky brightness (Schneeberger et al. 1979) is 21.9  V 

mag per square arcsecond, not including the darker, midwinter nights
(December-February).  The site is protected from growth in light
pollution by White Sands Missile Range and National Monument to the
west, the Lincoln
National Forest to the east, the Mescalero Apache Reservation to
the north, and the Fort Bliss Military Reservation to the south.  The growth
of nearby Alamogordo is expected to be limited by availability of water;
in any case, the City of Alamogordo in 1990 passed a lighting ordinance,
very favorable to astronomy,
which controls the types of lighting which can be used in public places
and places strict control on lighting after 11:00 PM.
In 1978, El Paso and Alamogordo contributed 10% of the sky brightness
at 85&deg; zenith angle and 2% of the sky brightness at 45% zenith
angle, at the respective azimuth angles of 180&deg; and 270&deg;.
Garstang (1989) has made light pollution projections based on a
population model (without account of changes in lighting ordinances)
and projects that the sky at the zenith will increase in brightness
by  0<sup>m</sup>.03  from 1990 to 2000.

<P>

All optical telescopes require clear, dark skies, but the operation of the

SDSS further requires that about 25% of the clear time be photometric
and have seeing  &lt;= 1" .  The ARC telescopes have been located at
APO because it fulfils these requirements.  The National Solar Observatory,
located at Sacramento Peak about half a mile from the APO site, ran
nighttime seeing tests with the vacuum tower telescope during 1976
and 1977.  The median seeing was 0.8 arcseconds and the seeing was
better than 1 arcsecond 56% of the time (Beckers et al. 1979).  The
APO site should be even better than this, since it typically samples a
more nearly undisturbed wind flow than does the Sacramento Peak site.

A weather tower was installed at APO in 1984 and has been in almost

continuous operation since, under the direction of Kurt Anderson (New
Mexico State University), the ARC site director.  This tower is located on
the ridge occupied by the 3.5 m and 2.5 m telescopes, about midway
between them.  The 23-m tower has microthermal sensors at heights of 9.2,
12.6, 16.8 and 21.4 meters above the ground.  Each sensor consists of two
coils of 40-micron nickel wire, separated by one vertical meter and connected
in a bridge circuit.  The resistance is temperature sensitive, and
the measured temperature differences can be converted to differences in the
index of refraction of the air at different levels, using the temperature
and pressure of the ambient air, also measured at the tower.
The mean-square differences of refractive index can then be converted
to the index of refraction <I>structure coefficient</I>  C<sub>n</sub>&sup2  for
Kolmogorov turbulence:
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC=fr_m_000.gif></CENTER>
<P>
where  h  is a vertical vector to a layer of height  h  and  r 
is a separation vector between two points.
<P>

With a vertical exponential scale length for the index variations and an

atmospheric model (a plane-parallel, standard atmospheric model was
used), the resulting structure coefficient is simply related to the
Fried parameter,  r<sub>0</sub>, (Roddier 1981) which in turn is related to angular
image size   theta  :   theta  ~  lambda /r<sub>0</sub> .
<P>

Eleven years of data are now available from this tower.  Seeing effects

at 1000 meters, measured by airplane flights in 1977 and 1978, can be
combined with the tower measurements to yield the scale height of the
index variations (Anderson and Morales 1991).  The results can be
summarized as follows: The seeing measured in this experiment has a
median near 0.7 arcseconds, and is below 0.5 arcsecond 10-20% of the time,
depending on the season.  The microthermal tests show that the seeing is
best in the winter months and worst in the late summer.  Typical
measurements for a month in November 1989 and another in June 1990 are
shown in Figure <A HREF="../site/site.htm#microThermalFig">3.4</A>.  The interpretation of these data
is not quite
straightforward; one could simply average the values at different
levels, or one could take the highest level as most representative of
the atmosphere above the tower; the actual contribution to the integral
of the values near the ground is small.  In any case, the results are
somewhat better, on average, than the direct measurements of
Beckers et al. (1979), possibly because of his smaller database, possibly
because his site is not quite so good, and certainly because his
measuring resolution was only 0.5 arcsecond.
<P>

We are not yet able to confirm  the expected good seeing performance

from direct observations with the ARC 3.5 m telescope, which has been in
operation for the past three years; the telescope optical system (particularly
the secondary mirror optical figure) has not yet been optimized.
The image size measured by the
Digital Imaging Spectrograph (DIS), is shown for the period November 1994 -
October 1995 in Figure <A HREF="../site/site.htm#APOSeeingIXIV">3.5</A>, and for October - November
1996 in Figure <A HREF="../site/site.htm#APOSeeingIXVI">3.6</A>. The image size measured by DIS in the
last year (November 1995 - October 1996) has been below  1.5"  70%
of the time, a big improvement.
<P>

Measurements of the optical figure of the telescope by C. Stubbs (1996)

show that the telescope optical system contributes  0.6"  while
the large pixel size ( 0.8" ) of DIS contributes about
 0.3" .  The intrinsic seeing corresponding
to an image size of  1.2"  (Figure <A HREF="../site/site.htm#APOSeeingIXVI">3.6</A>)
is then about  0.7" .  The median seeing at APO is thus less than
 1"  at visible wavelengths.  Observations with ARC's low-resolution
infrared spectrograph and imager (GRIM) yield a median seeing of
 0.8"  and have directly measured image sizes of  &lt; 1" 
25% of the time in 1996.  The 3.5 m data thus confirm that the seeing
at APO is good enough enough of the clear time (25%) to carry out the SDSS.
<P>

In summary, the Apache Point site is characterized by mild weather,

a very dark sky, a high incidence of clear skies, and topography which
ensures that the seeing is excellent a large percentage of the time.
Prior development of the site and proximity to the NSO make siting the
survey telescope there much less expensive and more convenient than
would be the case at any new site. The nature of the project makes it
highly desirable that a continental U.S. site be chosen, and we
doubt strongly that a better one exists for our purposes.
