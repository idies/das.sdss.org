<TITLE>Simulations of Survey Data</TITLE><H1><A NAME="simul">Simulations of Survey Data</A></H1><P>

We have carried out extensive efforts to simulate the data that will
be produced by the SDSS.  These simulations serve several 
interrelated purposes.
First, they provide data that we can use to test the survey's data acquisition
and reduction software. 
Second, they help us make informed decisions about survey strategy --
target selection criteria, geometry, scheduling, and so forth.
Third, they offer qualitative and quantitative predictions about 
what the SDSS should see, under specified theoretical assumptions.  
Fourth, they provide an artificial database that we can use to develop and 
test methods that we will eventually use to extract scientific information 
from the survey itself. 
Because the survey test year is fast approaching, we 
have so far focused our attention on the first of these applications,
testing survey software.  Once the survey is underway, the
fourth application will assume great importance, especially for large
scale structure studies.  We will use simulations like those described 
below to calibrate uncertainties and check for biases in our methods of
analysis, and to test the ability of the analysis to distinguish theoretical
models of the large scale structure.
<P>

There are a number of survey software tasks that require simulated data.

Of course we want to test the software on real data as well, but 
the real data will not be available until the survey
telescope is in operation, and it is in any case useful to have some 
test data for which the "right" answer is known in advance.  
At the most nitty-gritty level, we need simulated data to test the
photometric reduction software, everything from flat-fielding
the CCD images to classifying objects and selecting spectroscopic targets.
For this purpose, we need artificial  images  with realistic numbers of
objects, realistic magnitudes, colors, sizes, and profiles, realistic
clustering, and realistic seeing, noise, and defects.  In the end, we can
test for any biases in the selection of spectroscopic targets by passing
artificial catalogs through the complete data reduction pipeline and 
comparing the actual target list to the list of targets that would have
been selected if the data reduction were perfect. 
<P>

For many other tests, we need only simulated  catalogs , i.e. lists of

objects with photometric properties and positions on the sky.
We will use such catalogs to help us decide the selection criteria for
spectroscopic targets.  For galaxies, we want to know how different
choices of selection criteria will affect our ability to measure large
scale structure, and for quasars we want to estimate the impact of
stellar contamination on the target lists as a function of Galactic
latitude and longitude.  We will also use simulated catalogs to test
the efficiency of the tiling software described in Chapter <A HREF="../tiling/tiling.htm#tiling">12</A>,
and to 
study the effects of the minimum fiber spacing on our ability to sample
galaxy clusters, groups, and binaries.  The simulations also allow us
to examine the possible impact of photometry errors and uncertainty
in Galactic extinction on measurements of galaxy clustering. 
<P>

We have designed a three-tier system for creating simulated data;

we have implemented many parts of this system, and are continuing
to add new elements and refine existing ones.  The first tier creates
artificial sky catalogs -- lists of objects with positions and 
photometric parameters.  We use a large, cosmological N-body simulation
to provide a clustered galaxy distribution, and the 
Bahcall-Soneira (1984) model of the Galaxy for star counts.
The second tier turns the catalog for a specific patch of sky into artificial
images in the survey filter bands.  Spiral galaxies are represented by
inclined exponential disks, elliptical galaxies and bulges by 
spheroids with a de Vaucouleurs-law profile, and stars and quasars by point
sources.  The images are convolved with a point-spread function (PSF), and
noise and other artifacts (cosmic rays, diffraction spikes, etc.) are added,
as are the defects of real CCDs (see below).
The third tier of the simulation system turns a series of artificial
images into a data stream that looks like it is coming from the telescope's
data acquisition system.  We can thus run simulated data all the way
through the photometric data reduction pipeline.  
The next section describes the first tier of this system, sky
catalogs, in greater detail.  Section <A HREF="../simul/simul.htm#simulatedImages">9.2</A> describes
the other two tiers,
in particular our techniques for creating artificial images.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="simulatedCatalogs">Simulated Catalogs</A></H2><P>

<P>

A complete simulated catalog would list positions and parameters of galaxies, 

stars, and quasars, about a magnitude deeper than the
depth of the photometric survey, covering the
whole SDSS footprint on the sky.  Such a catalog would be rather unwieldy,
and in practice we use programs to create either a
photometric-depth catalog over a rather limited area of sky or a
catalog over the whole survey region but only to the depth of the
spectroscopic survey.  It is nonetheless useful to think in terms of "the"
catalog that in principle contains all of the objects that
the survey might observe in a simulated universe.  Our convention is
that the catalogs list "intrinsic" apparent parameters, with no
instrumental or atmospheric effects, the sort of numbers that we want
our data reduction software to produce and store in the data archive.
<P>

Galaxies are the most challenging component of the artificial catalog,

since we require a population of objects with realistic spatial clustering,
luminosities, diameters, and colors.  Trickier still, we need to include
any important <I>correlations</I> between these properties, to the extent
that they are known observationally.  The basis of the galaxy catalog
is a large N-body simulation run by Changbom Park and Richard Gott.
The simulation uses Park's (1990) particle-mesh, N-body code to evolve 
 380&sup3 ~ 55  million particles on a  600&sup3  mesh that represents
a comoving, periodic cube  600 h<sup>-1</sup> Mpc  on a side.
The background cosmological model is a flat universe with Omega<sub>0</sub>=0.4,
a cosmological constant Lambda<sub>0</sub>=0.6 , and a Hubble constant  h=0.6 .
The initial conditions are Gaussian fluctuations with a cold dark matter
(CDM) power spectrum corresponding to these values of   Omega<sub>0</sub> and  h .
The normalization of the initial fluctuations corresponds to a 
"bias factor" of 1.3 in spheres of radius  8 h<sup>-1</sup> Mpc , and
"galaxies" are represented by a
weakly biased subset of the full particle distribution, corresponding
to   nu &gt;0.7  peaks of the initial density field,
so that their clustering amplitude matches observations.
The number density of the biased particles is sufficient to represent
galaxies brighter than about  0.064 L<sub>*</sub>.  
There are just over 8 million galaxy particles in the simulation volume.
<P>

The logic behind using the CDM + Lambda   model is simple: it produces a 

galaxy distribution
whose clustering properties match existing observational data quite well
over a wide range of scales.  For the purpose of providing test data,
the physical attractiveness
or unattractiveness of the model is not particularly important -- we just
want something that looks reasonably like the observed universe.
To go from the distribution of particles in the N-body simulation to a
galaxy catalog, we need
to assign apparent fluxes and diameters in the survey bands, for an
"observer" located in one corner of the simulation cube.
Each galaxy particle is assigned an absolute blue (B<sub>T</sub>) luminosity 
drawn randomly from a Schechter luminosity function.
The luminosity distribution is cut off below  0.064 L<sub>*</sub> (about 3 magnitudes
below  M<sub>*</sub>) in order to match the galaxy density of the simulation.
Each galaxy is also assigned a randomly chosen Hubble type from E to Sc,  
with relative probabilities determined from the local galaxy density using
the observed morphology-density relation in the form given by
Postman &amp; Geller (1984).  The galaxy can then be assigned an apparent
flux in each of the survey bands using the appropriate colors and 
K-corrections; these are computed for each Hubble type using
Coleman et al.'s (1980) galaxy spectrophotometry and the
filter-response curves illustrated in Figure <A HREF="../camera/camera.htm#reponseCurveFig">4.1</A>.
To assign 
diameters in accordance with the luminosity, we use a mean relation
based on the fundamental plane (for ellipticals) and a Freeman law
(for disks).  We add scatter about these mean relations, so that our
simulated catalog includes both low surface brightness galaxies and
compact, high surface brightness galaxies.  
<P>

The N-body simulation is large enough to contain almost the full

galaxy redshift sample, without periodic replications.
To reach the depth of the photometric sample, we must wrap around
the periodic boundary several times.
A random line of sight through the box
is unlikely to pass near itself on later traversals,
so this is not a serious problem.
<P>

For this example, we adopted an apparent
magnitude limit of 17.55 in the  r'  band, and a minimum angular
diameter (at the half-light radius) of 2 arcseconds (these simulations
were done based on an earlier version of the target selection
criteria). These limits yield
just under a million galaxies over the survey region; about 2% of the
galaxies brighter than the limiting magnitude are rejected because
they are smaller than the imposed minimum diameter. 
<P>

The upper panel of Figure <A
HREF="../simul/simul.htm#simulSliceRepeatFig">9.1</A> is a 
6 degree by 130 degree redshift-space slice.
The lower panel shows the same
slice in real space, i.e. with peculiar velocities set to zero.
The redshift-space slice clearly shows "fingers-of-God" caused by
velocity dispersions in virialized groups and clusters.  These thicken
the extended filaments and sheets, making them more prominent.

shows a 6 degree by 130 degree
slice in redshift space -- each point represents a galaxy, plotted at
the distance indicated by its redshift.  The lower panel shows the
same slice in real space, with no peculiar velocity effects.
<HR>
<P>

The star catalog is based on the Bahcall-Soneira (1984) model of the

Galaxy, which provides star counts in  V  and  B-V .
These counts determine the local star density at specified latitude
and longitude; we choose the actual number of stars in a given area
by Poisson sampling this distribution.  Stars in the spectrophotometric
atlas of Gunn &amp; Stryker (1983) define fairly tight relations between
 B-V  and colors in the SDSS filters, so given a  V  magnitude and a
 B-V  color we can assign magnitudes to a star in all five bands.
We include binary stars with separations of 0.1 - 3 arcseconds and
magnitude differences up to 2.5 mag using the normalization and
separation distribution found by Gould et al. (1995) in the HST SnapShot 
Survey.
<P>

Our simulated catalog also includes quasars, for which

a random angular distribution is an
adequate approximation; the tricky thing is to get the appropriate 
distribution of colors, since this distribution is essential when
we try to estimate the efficiency of selection criteria at differentiating
quasars from stars. 
Another important element still to be added is Galactic
extinction; we will use the simulations to check the procedures for
computing and correcting this effect, as well as for checking the
algorithms for selecting stars whose colors can be used to measure
the extinction.
<P>

<H4>Images</H4><P>

The second tier of our simulated data system turns a catalog representing

a specific patch of sky into artificial images in the survey filter bands,
using code adapted from J. Gunn's Mirella/Mirage image-processing package.
In the current version of the image-making
code, an object is represented by a sum of up to three profiles:
a PSF, an inclined exponential disk convolved with
a PSF, and a de Vaucouleurs-law bulge convolved with a PSF.
Each catalog entry specifies the fraction of light in each of these
profiles (in each band), the effective radii and position angles 
of the bulge and disk components, and the inclination (for disks) or
axis ratio (for bulges).  We describe the adopted profiles below, then
summarize our procedures for adding noise and defects to the images,
and list some of the parameters that are used to define the images.
We show a few representative images in Figure
<A HREF="../simul/simul.htm#simulImageNSFig">9.2.2</A>.
<P>

i) PSF 

<P>

The simulations to date have used a PSF consisting of a

double-Gaussian core with an  r<sup>-3</sup>  power-law tail.
Thus, the intensity pattern produced by a point source of total flux  F<sub>0</sub> is
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC=fr_l_000.gif></CENTER>
<P>
with 
  alpha  = 0.9,  beta  = 3,  sigma<sub>1</sub>= 0.94  (pixel), and 
  sigma<sub>2</sub> = 2.7 (pixel).   K  is a normalization constant, and  f  
determines the fraction of the total light in the power-law component,
which we set to 0.075.  With these parameters,
the PSF corresponds approximately to 1 arcsec seeing. We can change 
  alpha ,  beta ,  sigma<sub>1</sub>, and   sigma<sub>2</sub> so that we obtain images with
various seeing conditions. 
<P>

A recent paper by Racine (1996) finds somewhat shallower power-law

wings (this is an important consideration for the effect of these wings
on sky brightness fluctuations; see Chapter <A HREF="../datasys/datasys.htm#datared">10</A>).  The new
simulations will use instead the PSF model suggested by Racine (1996), 
consisting of a superposition of three Moffat (1969) functions.  This
model produces a smoother PSF and a better representation of the
observed power-law wings.  However, the photometric pipeline (Section
<A HREF="../datasys/datasys.htm#datared">10</A>) will continue to characterize the PSF using the
formulation given above because this separable function is 
computationally very efficient.
<P>

We add diffraction spikes for stellar sources. 
The intensity pattern produced by a diffraction spike is:
<P>
<center>I<sub>spider</sub>(r,j) = spk<sub>amp</sub>(r) * spk<sub>cross</sub>(j),</center>
<P>
where
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC=fr_l_002.gif></CENTER>
gamma   = 10 (pixel),   delta   = 0.01,  I<sub>0</sub> is the central intensity 
of the star, and
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC=fr_l_003.gif></CENTER>
<P>
Here r represents a distance from the central star along an arm of the
diffraction cross, and  j  represents a distance transverse to the arm.
Thus  spk<sub>amp</sub>(r)  represents the "raw" intensity pattern of the
diffraction spike, and the convolution with  spk<sub>cross</sub>(j) 
incorporates the effect of seeing.  For stars that saturate the
full-well of the CCD, we add saturation tracks along the direction of
the charge transfer (the scanning direction).
<P>

ii) Galaxy Profiles 

<P>

Observed disk galaxies have profiles that are close to exponential out

to about four scale lengths, at which point they tend to cut off rather
sharply (van der Kruit and Searle, 1981).  
We therefore represent disks by a truncated exponential profile:
<CENTER><IMG SRC=fr_l_004.gif></CENTER>
Here   epsilon  = 0.59584  is the conversion factor between the 

exponential scale length and the effective radius  r<sub>e</sub>  containing half
the total light:  r<sub>s</sub>= epsilon  r<sub>e</sub> .
For the inclined profiles we assume that the disks are optically thin.
Ellipticals and bulges are represented by a de Vaucouleurs profile
(de Vaucouleurs, 1948),
<P>
<CENTER>I(r) = I<sub>0</sub>e<sup>-7.6692(r/r<sub>e</sub>)<sup>1/4</sup></sup>  ,</CENTER>
<P>

The above profiles are convolved with the PSF before being added to the
image.  In practice, we interpolate and scale from a catalog of template 
images.  In future versions of the simulations, we plan to represent the
the brighter galaxies using suitably scaled CCD images of nearby galaxies 
instead of idealized models. (cf. Frei et al. 1996).
We will also adopt a PSF form that corresponds more exactly to 
the optical design of the telescope.
<P>

iii) Noise and Defects

<P>

For each catalog and filter, we make images with varying degrees of noise

and other defects.  At the simplest level, we have noiseless images that
precisely represent the objects in the input catalog.  We can easily
make images with Gaussian photon and readout noise. 
At a higher level of sophistication, we can make images with
photon noise and a background taken directly from one of the test CCDs,
including dark current and cosmic rays.  We can also `un-flatten' images
using flat-field vectors obtained from test CCDs.
We have developed code to include in the simulations nastier problems
such as the first and second order filter ghosts (which begin to
appear around stars of magnitude  15<sup>m</sup>  and  7<sup>m</sup>  respectively), as
well as satellite tracks, airplanes, and so forth.  The photometric pipeline
will have to identify and handle all of these complications,
and we must test its ability to do so.
<P>

iv) Parameters

<P>

At present, we create images using the following parameters.
The image scale is 0.400 arcsec/pixel.
Readout noise is 5 electrons rms.
The AD unit is determined so that 1 DN corresponds to 2, 4, 6, 6, and
6 electrons from  u'  to  z' .
All magnitudes are on the AB system (where 0 mag represents a
flux-density of 3630 Jy).
A 1 Jy flux density gives  qfactor x qt dl l  electrons, where 
 qfactor  =  3.02x 10<sup>9</sup> 
and  qtdll  = 0.047, 0.121, 0.120, 0.082, and 0.021
for  u' ,  g' ,  r' ,  i' , and  z' ,
respectively.  This value of  qfactor 
assumes an exposure time of 55 seconds and secondary obscuration of 25%.
For the southern survey, we adopt a typical exposure time of 1650 seconds.
The assumed sky brightness (V=21.7mag  arcsec<sup>-2</sup> ) based on 
the sky spectrum at the Palomar (Turnrose, 1974)
is 23.1, 22.1, 21.1, 20.3, and 18.9 mag 
 arcsec<sup>-2</sup>  for  u' ,  g' ,  r' ,  i' , 
and  z' .
Atmospheric extinction is 0.675, 0.223, 0.111, 0.097, and 0.135 from 
 u'  to  z'  at 1.0 airmass; we typically adopt an airmass of 1.2.
Image files are written in FITS U16 format.
<P>

v) Examples

<P>

We have also made simulated images of the deeper, southern survey,

for which the exposure time is about 30 times that of
images in the northern survey. Figure <A HREF="../simul/simul.htm#simulImageNSFig">9.2.2</A> shows
examples of the simulated images for fields from the northern and
southern surveys.  The simulated field has a star density appropriate
to  (l,b)   =   (0&deg;, 40&deg;) .  The 
horizontal axis is the east-west (scanning) direction.  
Figures <A HREF="../simul/simul.htm#simulImageNorthGFig">9.2a</A> and
<A HREF="../simul/simul.htm#simulImageSouthGFig">9.2b</A> show portions of the  g' 
images, 512  x  512 pixels, with noise levels corresponding to the
northern and southern surveys, respectively.  We use the same object catalog
for the two images, to allow direct comparison.  Figures
<A HREF="../simul/simul.htm#simulImageNorthRFig">9.2c</A> and <A HREF="../simul/simul.htm#simulImageSouthRFig">9.2d</A>
show the corresponding  r'  images.

<H4>Test Data</H4><P>

We can test individual components of the data reduction software using

simulated images like those described above.  However, we also want to test the
operation and integration of the full photometric pipeline, and for
this we need a complete data stream that looks as if it is coming from
the telescope.
The third tier of our simulated data system
turns a catalog covering a long strip of sky into such a data stream,
including observation logs, astrometric and photometric parameters,
postage stamps, quartiles, star lists, and raw (un-flattened) image frames
(see Chapter <A HREF="../datasys/datasys.htm#datared">10</A>, Data Systems, for details).
We use realistic values for atmospheric extinction, sky brightness,
atmospheric refraction, and so forth, and even include real
astrometric standard stars from the standard catalogs.
We prepare the test data in the actual format of the survey system,
on DAT tapes.
<P>

We can use these simulated data to ask fairly detailed questions.

If the sky brightness slowly increases over the duration of a photometric
scan, does the photometric calibration software correct properly?
What is the relative performance of the system at low and high Galactic
latitudes?  While the test year will no doubt bring some software surprises,
the use of simulations has allowed us to have the data system integrated 
and largely debugged before the telescope itself is fully operational.
The ability to use the same underlying data with varying degrees of
complication will help isolate problems during debugging.
The existence of a catalog with the "right" answers corresponding to
a given simulation allows us to do regression testing in a
detailed and quantitative way.
