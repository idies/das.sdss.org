<H1>Requirements</h1>

CHH, DJH, SK, JAM, DLP, and BY met on 12/6 and drew up a tenative list of requirements
for interactive manipulation of FITS files and the database:

<ul>
  <li> Place the data from FITS binary tables and FITS ASCII tables in
       an Objectivity Database. Optimise per-file overheads over
       memory. Assume FITS files are small enough that
       having multiple copies of the data im memory is not a burden.
       The tool should be fast enough to stuff the outputs of photo
       in a resonable time.
       
  <li> Place data from a query of the database into FITS files. Somehow,
       deal with the fact that a query could return much more data
       than is proper to put into a file.
       
  <li> Deal with "something like a list" of both objects and C-schema.
       The source of the lists is either the data base (object lists) or
       FITS files (C -lists).
       
       The representations are to be held in memory. Be able to
       generate new lists, given a set of lists. Be able to form expressions of
       the data members, be able to control iteration over the lists.

       For lists of objects, be able to go back and forth (i.e edit) objects,
       including putting them back into the database, optionally preserving
       oids.
       
  <li> Given lists in memory, be able to apply operations to 250,000 of them
       in 300 seconds. Be able to match two lists of 250,000 in the style of
       target selection in _____ seconds.
       
</ul>
<H1>DERVISH Expression Evaluator Functional Specifications</H1>
This document specifies the functional specifications for a new DERVISH-based
expression evaluator.

<h2>Motivation</h2>
The survey currently supports TCL interfaces to the following complex data
types:
<dl>
  <dt><a href="/dervish/doc/www/dervish.dump.html#diskio">SCHEMA</a>
  <dd>These are C structures, whose schema are accesible from DERVISH.  Values
      of members of instances may be fetched and set with the TCL verbs
      <a href="/dervish/doc/www/tclDiskio.html#membersGet">membersGet</a> and
      <a href="/dervish/doc/www/tclDiskio.html#memberSet">memberSet</a>.
  <dt><a href="/dervish/doc/www/dervish.chain.html">CHAIN</a>
  <dd>A doubly linked list of instances of SCHEMA.
  <dt><a href="/dervish/doc/www/dervish.fitsio.html">TBLCOL</a>.
  <dd>These are tables of data, originally created to read in FITS ASCII and
      Binary Tables.  Currently, most access to FITS tables goes through
      a TBLCOL.
  <dt>FITS ASCII and Binary Tables.
  <dd>While these are currently supported through TBLCOLs, we may be able
      to interface to these files more efficiently at times without passing
      though a TBLCOL.  Currently, the Frames Pipeline is doing this with
      their own special sortware.
  <dt><a href="/sdb/doc/www/sdb.home.html">SDB</a>-Supported C++ Classes
  <dd>These are C++ classes whose public methods and constructors are
      accessible through TCL.  Instances of such C++ classes may represent
      objects stored in an Objectivity database.
  <dt><a href="/dervish/doc/www/dervish.hgaf.html">AF</a>
  <dd>An array of floats.  Each element also contains an error and a mask.
      Is this still an officially supported type?
  <dt><a href="/dervish/doc/www/tclVectorExpr.html#VectorDefn">VECTOR</a>
  <dd>A vector of floating point values.  These are a intended to be a
      replacement for AFs, though utilities are provided to translate between
      the two types.  VECTORS may be filled from, or fill, the values of
      members on a CHAIN (the members must be first-level members; i.e., the
      member cannot be specified using the grammar supported by
      <em>handleExprEval</em>).
</dl>
Additionally, the following complex data types lack TCL interfaces:
<dl>
  <dt><a href="/dervish/doc/www/dervish.array.html">ARRAY</a>
  <dd>Multi-dimensional arrays of SCHEMA.  Its not clear to me what their
      role is in the world of DERVISH.
</dl>
<p>
A number of tools exist which provide a means for evaluating
arbitrary mathematical expressions containing TCL handles to some of the DERVISH
complex data structures list above.  These tools are completely
independent of each other, essentially sharing no code.  Each tool supports
only one or two complex data types.  These tools include:
<dl>
  <dt><a href="/dervish/doc/www/tclHandle.html#handleExprEval">handleExprEval</a>
  <dd>Allows a user to access a data element from a DERVISH handle to an instance
      of a known SCHEMA using a subset of the full C grammar
      (e.g., <code>handleExprEval h12.mask->rows<1><2></code>).  This calls
      the C routine <a href="/dervish/doc/www/handleExpr.c.html"><code>shTclHandleExprEval()</code></a> (see link for the supported grammar).  Additional
      TCL procs provide a friendly interface based on this verb,
      including setting and fetching the value of individual data
      members.  These include
      <a href="/dervish/doc/www/tclProcedures.html#exprPrint">exprPrint</a>,
      <a href="/dervish/doc/www/tclProcedures.html#exprPrintAsArray">exprPrintAsArray</a>,
      <a href="/dervish/doc/www/tclProcedures.html#exprMember">exprPrintMember</a>, and
      <a href="/dervish/doc/www/tclProcedures.html#exprSet">exprSet</a>.
      This works on a single instance object; its does not support any of the
      container data types.  It does not support any mathematical operations,
      but rather simply allows access to individual data elements within a
      C structure, including the ability to follow pointers, access individual
      elements in an array, etc.
  <dt><a href="/dervish/doc/www/tclVectorExpr.html#vectorExprEval">vectorExprEval</a>
  <dd>Evaluates an arbitrary methematical expression.  The only complex data
      type the expression may contain is a DERVISH handle to a VECTOR.  Multiple
      VECTORs may be contained in the same expression so long as they are of
      the same length.
  <dt><a href="/dervish/doc/www/dervish.f2s.html">TBLCOL/Schema Conversion</a>
  <dd>This converts data in a TBLCOL to a homogenous CHAIN, and
      vice-versa.  It is done by parsing a translation table, which is
      converted into an operation stack.  The looping over individual rows in
      the TBLCOL and individual elements in the CHAIN is done at the
      C level.
  <dt><a href="/sdb/doc/www/fitsdb.html">TBLCOL/C++ Class Conversion</a>
  <dd>This converts data in a TBLCOL to a C++ container class containing
      instances of C++ classes, and vice versa.  It was created primarily to
      tranfer data between FITS tables and the survey databases.
      It is done by parsing a
      translation table, which is converted into an operation stack.  The
      looping over individual rows in the TBLCOL and individual elements in
      the container class is done at the C++ level.  Methods may be strung
      together and links followed (i.e., h1.calibration()->trans().a()).
      This facility was written under Versant and has not yet been converted
      to Objectivity, therefore it is currently defunct.
  <dt>SCHEMA-to-FITS
  <dd>Robert Lupton has written a tool for the Frames Pipeline to dump SCHEMA
      instances directly to FITS tables, bypassing DERVISH's TBLCOL interface.
</dl>
<p>
The above list of tools bears witness to the usefulness of expression
evaluators to the survey.  It also evidences our history of having created
such a tool multiple times, each design and implementation mostly independent
of the others, and each tool limited in terms of which set of DERVISH-based
complex data types it supports.  Each time we've found a need for such an
evaluator for a specific task, we have created a separate evaluator which
works only for that specific task.  There will surely be tasks ahead of us
which call for expression evaluators outside the scope of the current set of
tools, some of which we cannot now predict.
<p>
One such task is at hand.  We require a tool which allows us an efficient
browsing capability to data in the survey databases.  It should allow us to
manipulate and play with the data; e.g., follow pointers, perform mathematical
calculations, plot results, etc.  Such a task calls for an expression
evaluator which can handle C++ class methods, and which can produce results
which can be interfaced to the current set of DERVISH tools for examining
data (e.g., VECTORS, pgplot, etc).
Thus we are faced with the prospect of either creating yet another expression
evaluator, or modifying one of the current ones.
<p>
The current set of tools presents real concerns for long-term support.  Some
of the implementations are themselves not readily supported, and the prospects
of supporting numerous such pieces of software is daunting.  We have learned
much while implementing the current set of tools, and would do much differently
were we to do it again.  And we will have to do it again.
<p>
We propose to do it again, one last time.  The proposal is for a single
expression evaluator which can support all of our tasks.  It will be designed
in such a way as to support the addition of new complex data types.  It will
be based on a grammar, allowing later extensions to the grammar.  A single
such expression evaluator will greatly simplify our long-term support
requirements, as well as provide a constant user interface.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
We impose the following requirements on our new expression evaluator:
<ul>
  <li>It must support all of the current set of DERVISH-based complex data types.
      More specifically, we require support for the data types SCHEMA, CHAIN,
      TBLCOL, C++ classes, AF, and VECTOR.  Support for direct access to FITS
      tables is an enhanced goal.
  <li>It must be designed such that additional complex data types may be added
      easily.
  <li>It must be based on a grammar, designed in such a way as to easily
      support future extensions to the grammar.
  <li>A given expression may contain a mixture of all supported DERVISH-based
      complex data types.  All public data elements in a given type should be
      able to be set or fetched, and all public methods for C++ classes
      invoked.
  <li>SCHEMA (either individual instances or all instances in a CHAIN) must be
      supported with all the functionality of <code>handleExprEval</code>.  C++
      class methods must be supported, including the ability to cascade method
      calls.
  <li>It must be able to create new instances, including persistent instances
      of C++ classes in an Objectivity database.
  <li>The expression must be parsed into an operation stack once, and that
      operation stack executed for each element in a container class (e.g.,
      CHAINs).
  <li>Loops over container classes must be performed at the C/C++ level.
  <li>It must be able to run within a C environment (clearly minus its
      interface to C++ classes), as well as a C++ environment.
  <li>It should be able to determine the required behavior simply by
      parsing the string.  For example, it must be able to determine whether
      the expression contains container objects, know that it must therefore
      be able to loop over that container, and check that all containers to be
      looped over in the expression are of the same length.
</ul>

<H2>Functional Specifications</h2>

<H3>TCL Interface</H3>

The TCL interface will be provided by a single TCL verb, <em>evalExpr</em>.
<p>
<PRE>
evalExpr &lt;expression&gt;
</PRE>
where <var>expression</var> is a string, consisting of one or more
<def>compound statements</def> separated by semi-colons. 
It returns a TCL list, each list element being either a DERVISH handle or
a blank ({}), one element for each compound-statement in the expression.  
<p>
Additionally, we may want to provide verbs like <em>sortExpr</em>,
<em>selectExpr</em>, etc.

<H3>C/C++ Interface</H3>

TBD.  Whatever it is, it should be C functions (not C++).

    ...
</PRE>	
    where <var>schema-handle</var> is a DERVISH handle to a SCHEMA instance,
    and <VAR>member</VAR> is a data member of that
    SCHEMA.  The specified data members will be set for that single instance.
    The SCHEMA handle is returned.  The SCHEMA must already exist.
 <P>

<DD> Syntax:
<PRE>
    chain-handle;
    member = expr;
    member = expr;
    ...
</PRE>	
    where <var>chain-handle</var> is a DERVISH handle to a homogeneous CHAIN
    of instances of SCHEMA, and <VAR>member</VAR> is a data member of that
    SCHEMA.  The specified data members will be set for each element of the
    CHAIN as the main loop is executed.  The CHAIN handle is returned.  The
    CHAIN must already exist.
 <P>
<DT> array-assignment
<DD> Syntax:

    array-handle;
    member = expr;
    member = expr;
    ...
</PRE>	
    where <var>array-handle</var> is a DERVISH handle to an ARRAY of instances
    of SCHEMA, and <VAR>member</VAR> is a data member of that SCHEMA.
    The specified data members will be set for each element of the
    ARRAY as the main loop is executed.  The ARRAY handle is returned.  The
    ARRAY must already exist.
 <P>
<DT> known-schema-assignment
<DD> Syntax:
<PRE>
    known-schema-name;
    member = expr;
    member = expr;
    ...
</PRE>	
    where <var>known-schema-name</var> is the name of a known C struct SCHEMA,
    and	<VAR>member</VAR> is a data member of that SCHEMA.
    A new CHAIN of type <VAR>known-schema-name</VAR> will be created,  The
    specified data members will be set for each element of the CHAIN as the
    main loop is executed.  The CHAIN handle is returned.  If the expression
    contains no container objects, then the CHAIN consists of a single object.
 <P>
<DT> tblcol-assignment
<DD> Syntax:

    ...
</PRE>	
    where <var>tblcol-handle</var> is a DERVISH handle to a TBLCOL.  The TBLCOL
    must exist, but it need not have any space allocated yet.  If its size is
    0, then its size is determined by the length of the main loop.  There can
    be no iterators in the any of the <VAR>expr</VAR> so that the length can
    be determined by the parser.  If its size is greater than 0, then it must
    be at least as long as the length of the main loop.  If the elementary
    data type is specified in a field assignment statement, then that field is
    assumed not to exist in the TBLCOL (it is an error if it does), and a new
    field is added to the TBLCOL.  If the elementary data type is not
    specified, then that field is assumed to exist in the TBLCOL (it is an
    error if it doesn't).  The specified fields will be set for each row of the
    TBLCOL as the main loop is executed.  The TBLCOL handle is returned.

</PRE>	
    where <var>fits-handle</var> is a DERVISH handle to a FITS struct.  The
    FITS struct must exist, but it need not be defined yet.  If the elementary
    data type is specified in a field assignment statement, then that field is
    assumed not to exist in the FITS (it is an error if it does), and a new
    field is added to the FITS.  If the elementary data type is not
    specified, then that field is assumed to exist in the FITS struct (it is
    an error if it doesn't).  The specified fields will be written for each
    row of the FITS as the main loop is executed.  The FITS handle is returned.
 <P>

    CHAINs as the main loop is executed.  Nothing is returned.
 <P>
<DT> array-member-assignment
<DD> Syntax:
<PRE>
    array-handle.member = expr;
    array-handle.member = expr;
    ...
</PRE>	
    where <var>array-handle</var> is DERVISH handle to an existing ARRAY
    of instances of SCHEMA, and <VAR>member</VAR> is a member in that SCHEMA.
    The ARRAY must
    be long enough to accomodate the main loop.  Multiple ARRAYs may be
    assigned to.  The specified fields will be set for each element of the
    ARRAYs as the main loop is executed.  Nothing is returned.
 <P>
<DT> tblcol-field-assignment
<DD> Syntax:

 <P>
<DT> constructor
<DD> Syntax:
<PRE>
    class-name(clustering-directive, expr, expr, ...)
</PRE>	
    where <var>class-name</var> is the name of an SDB supported C++ class,
    and <VAR>clustering-directive</VAR> is a DERVISH handle to a valid object
    which may be used as an Objectivity clustering directive.  If
    <VAR>clustering-directive</VAR> is 0, then transient objects are created;
    if blank (""), then they are created in the default database.
    A new <EM>ooTVArray(ooHandle(<VAR>class-name</VAR>))</EM> is created.
    The constructor will be called once for each element of the loop, and the
    resultant object stored in the <EM>ooTVArray</EM>.  A DERVISH handle to

    class-handle.method(expr, expr, ...);
    ...
</PRE>
    This is intended to support calling C++ methods which may not necessarily
    have return values.  If the <var>class-handle</var> is a container class
    (either <code>ooVArray</code>, <code>ooTVArray</code>, or
    <code>ooItr</code>) then we will be looping.  Else, we assume its a
    single object.  A blank is returned.	
 <P>
</DL>
<p>
Above, the token <em>member</em> refers to any data member of a SCHEMA which
can be referenced using <code>handleExprEval</code>.

<H3>Right-Hand-Side Expression Syntax</H3>
On the right hand side of every assignment, and passed in as arguemnts to
methods and functions, are <def>expression</def>s.  These are C++ like
right-hand-side(rhs) arithmetic expressions, with support for accessing
structure data members and C++ class methods.  It may contain any of the
following:
<DL>
<DT> vector-handle
<DD> A DERVISH handle to a VECTOR.  Data members and methods attached to the
     handle refer not to the VECTOR, but to the individual elements of the
     VECTOR as the main loop is executed.
<DT> chain-handle
<DD> A DERVISH handle to a CHAIN.  Data members and methods attached to the
     handle refer not to the CHAIN, but to the individual elements of the
     CHAIN as the main loop is executed.
<DT> array-handle
<DD> A DERVISH handle to an ARRAY.  Data members and methods attached to the
     handle refer not to the ARRAY, but to the individual elements of the
     CHAIN as the main loop is executed.
<DT> ooTVArray/ooVArray-handle
<DD> A DERVISH handle to an <EM>ooTVArray</EM> or an <EM>ooVArray</EM>.
     Data members and
     methods attached to the handle refer not to the array, but to the
     individual elements of the array as the main loop is executed.
<DT> ooItr-handle
<DD> A DERVISH handle to an <EM>ooItr</EM>.  Data members and methods attached
     to the handle refer not to the iterator, but to the individual elements of
     the iterator as they are accessed as the main loop is executed.
<DT> tblcol-handle
<DD> A DERVISH handle to a TBLCOL.  Fields attached to the
     handle refer not to the TBLCOL, but to the individual rows of the
     TBLCOL as the main loop is executed.
<DT> fitstbl-handle -- <strong>ENHANCED GOAL</strong>
<DD> A DERVISH handle to a FITS struct.  Fields attached to the
     handle refer not to the FITS struct, but to the individual rows of the
     FITS file as the main loop is executed.
<DT> object-handle
<DD> A DERVISH handle to a C++ object.  Data members and methods attached to the
     handle refer to the same object and generate the same value for each
     element in the main loop.
<DT> schema-handle
<DD> A DERVISH handle to a C struct SCHEMA.  Data members and methods attached        to the handle refer to the same object and generate the same value for
     each element in the main loop.
<DT> literal
<DD> Either a quoted character string, or a number.
<DT> operator
<DD> Any supported operator.  This will include '.' and '->' applied to
     class and struct handles.
</DL>
Looping is determined by the handles contained in the expression.  By default,
it will loop for the length of the shortest <EM>CHAIN</EM>, <EM>ARRAY</EM>,
<EM>ooItr</EM>, <EM>ooVArray</EM>, <EM>ooTVArray</EM>, or <em>VECTOR</em>.
If the lengths of all such structures vary, a warning will be issued.
