Operational Databases in the SDSS survey

The duties of the operational database system may be
divided into three main subsystems:

A. Guiding the mountain top operations, generating observing
	plans for the upcoming lunation, and keeping track of which 
	stripes of the survey have been observed successfully so far.
	
B. Staging raw data from the mountain top tapes to the processing 
	pipelines back at Fermilab.  This involves generating 
	processing plans for each pipeline,  Storing all parameters 
	used to run each pipeline, and generating auxiliary files
	to be used by the pipelines such as previously known 
	object catalogs.

C. Storing the outputs of the pipelines, applying calibrations,
	generating final calibrated catalogs of objects to
	export to the Science Archive Database,
	and directing target selection for spectroscopic 
	fiber targeting,


These three systems are shown as heavily outlined boxes in Figure <a href="opdb.ps">XX</a>.
The flow of information from the operational databases to and from
the mountain and to and from the processing pipelines are indicated
by arrows.  The products of each pipeline are indicated within
each pipeline's box.

The operational database system is based on the commercial 
object-oriented data base system "Objectivity".
The interface to the OPDB is supported by the 
C and TCL-based "dervish" interactive 
programming system developed at FNAL and Princeton.
Currently the system will run on a 6-CPU Silicon Graphics
Challenge machine with about 60-100GB of spinning disk and
access to a hierarchical storage tape robot with 3-4TB of
on-line secondary storage.  Tertiary storage of 12-24TB is in 
the form of racks of "DLT" hi-density tapes.  Data is transferred
from the mountain top to FNAL for processing on DLT tapes.

Brian Yanny and Jeff Munn are currently based at FNAL and are
responsible for delivering a completed operational database system
within the next six months.  The designing data model
is nearing completion, the interfaces to all the pipelines
have been defined and implementation of code
to stage the data into and out of
the database in a systematic fashion is underway.
