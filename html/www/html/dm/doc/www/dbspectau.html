SDSS Spectroscopic Operations Plan v1.3

Preface to V1.3

	Corrections and modifications in the CNC DRILLING FILE section were 
sugested by Walt Siegmund. Comments about handling dead fibers are 
included in the mapper section. File formats haven't been fixed (things
like uppercase keywords and non-dervish-par structure that might be changed)
but we'll update this document when the real files expose themselves.

Preface to V1.2

	This will be the last posting of this file for awhile. It is time to 
check the concept in the real world. Thanks to all who sent their 
comments. I continue to solicit advice.
	The question of duplicate-keyword parameter files is left hanging but 
if you know that YOU will have to read one of these files, please let me 
know (all data in the parameter files will find its way into the FITS 
headers, so it might not be important to read the text files).
	All changes are minor, although the role of the PLUGPLATE TARGET FILE 
was clarified in my mind. It no longer contains exposure information 
because its role is science, not implementation.

Preface to V1.1

	I've added some clarification text and started to move to Brian 
Yanny's ASCII parameter file format. Filenames seem to be undecided so I 
haven't changed my suggestions. Eileen Berman will have a file checksum 
routine added to Dervish (there are at least two unix sum commands; while 
one can do both methods, it's a simple thing to add to Dervish and might 
prevent confusion later).
	Most other changes are minor (for example, NAXIS=2 instead of 3 for 
the output files). Keep those suggestions coming.

Preface to V1.0

	The spectroscopic operations plan is simple, but because many people 
are involved in the final product, it's a good idea to agree on details 
and responsibilities. I would appreciate a critical reading of this, 
with comments to au@jhu.edu.
	There are many gaps that need to be filled, and if you can 
contribute, please send me what you can. Even if you don't know the 
details, I can find out and insert it.

Preface to v0.1

	Future editions of this will be posted only to sdss-strategy. If you 
are not on this mailing list, send email to
			sdss-request@astro.princeton.edu
and ask to be put on the sdss-strategy mailing list.
	Please examine this carefully and send changes to au@jhu.edu. The 
intent is to account for all major operations activities needed to run 
the spectroscopic portion of the SDSS. Implementation details are not 
important at this stage, but please note things that interfere or 
preclude alternatives.
	In many cases I make specific recommendations (for example, I say 
"use FTP" in a few places). These are usually flexible choices and most 
have not been considered in detail. Please send updates.
	I also mention who is responsible for what, but these also are 
guesses. A good reason to read this is to make sure you're not 
responsible for more that you think you are(!). People named might want 
to reassign tasks to others (please inform them!). The goal of version 
1.0 (hopefully the next) is to have all assignments clarified.

I. Introduction

	The practical aspects of gathering SDSS spectroscopic data, from 
target selection to data delivery, are explained here. This document is 
intended both as a reference for system developers and an introduction 
for implementers.
	Most activities produce a computer file so these are examined 
closely. The format and contents of these files are documented here. 
Also listed are the people responsible for definition and delivery of 
these files.

II. Target Selection

A. Plugplate Target File (Rich Kron)

	Spectroscopic targets are selected on criteria set by the science 
working groups. After target selection, plugplate center coordinates are 
chosen by an optimizing procedure called the tiling run to maximize the 
number of objects observed.
	The plugplates are then populated with targets. This occurs after 
tiling because tiling is based on galaxy and quasar locations and should 
be immune to locations of guide stars, sky holes, etc. The list of 
objects on a particular plugplate is the PLUGPLATE TARGET FILE.
	This file is called out and saved because it is the last point where 
targets can be selected, deleted, or modified before drilling. The 
PLUGPLATE TARGET FILE might look like this:

# PLUGPLATE TARGET FILE
DATE 1998/10/23
FIELDC 12:43:33.24 +23:44:22.5 J2000.0
COORSOL FK5-2053
TILERUN 24352
KEY OBJECT NAME RA DEC RAPM DECPM EPOCHPM TYPE g g-r FLAGS
KEY SKY RA DEC
OBJECT target1-a 182.444556 23.444456 10 2 1967 STAR 16.5 1.03 DUPLICATE
...
OBJECT target1-b 182.434566 23.444456 0 0 1967 GALAXY 16.9 1.20 AGN
SKY 182.413443 23.452310

This file lists the objects associated with a particular pointing. No 
exposure information is included (exposure time, hour angles, etc.) 
because this file might be created long before the observation. The 
details should be determined as late as possible so the most accurate 
observing date and instrument information can be used.
	The FIELDC is the plugplate field center. The COORSOL is the 
coordinate solution referred to by RA and DEC. (This might be useful if 
a coordinate recalibration alters target names, for example.) The 
TILERUN is the unique job number that produced the tiling solution for 
this plate and its siblings. For object records, NAME might be a common 
catalog name or a coordinate name (suggestions?), RA and DEC are what 
you think they are (use field center's equinox date), RAPM, DECPM, are 
proper motions (mas/yr, useful for guide stars with known proper motions 
and high proper motion targets), EPOCHPM is the date at which the RA and 
DEC are correct (format example 1998.2). TYPE is one of (GALAXY, QUASAR, 
STAR, STANDARD, SKY, GUIDESTAR, or LIGHTTRAP, explained later). The 
intent of TYPE is to help the observer identify spectra on the screen 
("my star is three down from the bright quasar at location 242"). PHOTOM 
is g' and g'-r', and FLAGS is one or more of (DUPLICATE, AGN, COLOR, 
PROPERMOTION, and other things).
	A LIGHTTRAP is an undersized plugplate hole at a bright star. This 
hole will not receive a fiber but will allow light to pass through the 
plugplate instead of being reflected and possibly contaminating faint 
object observations. No special device will be inserted into these 
holes.
	The DUPLICATE flag is set when an object appears on more than one 
plugplate. This can be useful for quality analysis (find all the objects 
observed more than once so we can compare them). AGN and COLOR flags 
might be set if the object was selected because of its AGN properties 
(such as a stellar nucleus as opposed to a usual color-selected quasar), 
or if a star was selected because of its unusual color or proper motion. 
We can evaluate selection criteria by looking at the flags.

B. Plugplate Drilling File (Rich Kron)

	The PLUGPLATE TARGET FILE is the input to drilling routines that 
create the PLUGPLATE DRILLING FILE. These routines map RA and DEC to 
(x,y) positions on the plugplate using information about the telescope 
optics (for geometric distortions), anticipated temperature at the 
observatory (to guess plate scale), and declination and anticipated hour 
angle (to correct for atmospheric refraction).
	The PLUGPLATE DRILLING FILE contains all the information of the 
PLUGPLATE TARGET FILE plus additional information for drilling:

KEY QUALITY X Y
QUALITY 89.50 23.10
...
QUALITY 799.14 315.89

We carry accumulated information even if it is not immediately useful. 
For example, the astronomical coordinates are not important at this 
stage. The intent is to simplify the development and maintenance of 
programs using the data. Using one input stream to create one output 
stream is usually best. The penalty is file size, but this cannot be a 
problem.
	The DRILTEMP is the temperature used by the drilling algorithm as a 
prediction for the temperature at which the plate will be drilled. The 
difference between this and the telescope temperature should be good 
enough to anticipate the correct scaling for the telescope.
	A new keyword, QUALITY, is added to note the locations of quality 
control reference holes. These are necessarily the same size as object 
and sky holes but must not be plugged with fibers. Their appearance here 
allows them to be tagged for "not plugging" during the viewgraph manual 
marking operation.
	This file and its checksum is transmitted from Fermilab via FTP to 
the observer's workstation (SGI) at Apache Point. The observer's 
workstation automatically verifies correct receipt or sends a checksum 
error message back to Fermilab. The name of the file is of the form 
001234.drl where the 001234 is the plugplate identifier noted in the 
header. This makes it easy to find the file for a particular plugplate.
	The checksum information guarantees that the files have not been 
modified after receipt at Apache Point. Most data transfer protocols 
(FTP, Kermit, Xmodem, nfs, etc.) use error checking so we are not 
worried about transmission errors. Inadvertent changes by humans, 
however, are easily caught with a checksum. We should also make sure 
that the receiving routines write the files as read-only.

C. CNC DRILLING FILE (Walt Siegmund)

	The PLUGPLATE DRILLING FILE is the source for the machinist's 
drilling program, the CNC DRILLING FILE. This file is generated directly 
from the PLUGPLATE DRILLING FILE residing on the observer's workstation 
at Apache Point. The plugplate (x,y) coordinates are reordered to 
improve drilling efficiency and transformed to the bent-plate projection 
(the plugplates are bent over a mandrel during drilling so the fibers 
will point in the correct direction when installed on the telescope). 
This file is a dead-end branch and no further information will be 
derived from the CNC DRILLING FILE. Walt Siegmund supplied this example:

	The expected delivery date of the CNC DRILLING FILE is sent to Survey 
Strategy where tracking and followup occur.
	Someone asked why the CNC DRILLING FILE is not generated at Fermilab. 
The reason is that the PLUGPLATE DRILLING FILE from which the CNC FILE 
is generated does not officially exist until it arrives at Apache Point. 
There is, of course, no technical reason why the CNC file cannot be made 
at Fermilab, but its pedigree is untracable unless we create another 
file that is pretty much the same as the PLUGPLATE FILE at Apache Point. 
If we do that, there is the possibility of modifications before shipping 
the file to Apache Point but after the CNC file is created. Because the 
PLUGPLATE DRILLING FILE cannot be modified once it arrives at Apache 
Point, this is the correct place to generate the CNC file. For these 
operations I am willing to give up considerable convenience for clarity 
and simplicity.

D. Drilling

	The plugplates are drilled and the plugplate identification number is 
manually stamped on the edge. The plugplates are painted black on the 
sky side and have a pushing post in the middle that occupies 3.2 mm 
radius, preventing fiber placement in that region.

E. Plugplate receipt (Bruce Gillespie)

	Daytime staff at Apache Point receive the plugplates and inspect them 
for damage. Receipt and condition information is transmitted to Survey 
Strategy, which takes any necessary action (replaces bad plugplates, for 
example).
	I recently watched observers at Las Campanas when they discovered 
that half the holes in their plugplate were too big and the fibers fell 
out. I'm sure we'll develop a list of appropriate quality checks for our 
plugplates.

III. Plugging and unplugging

A. Marking plugplates (Walt Siegmund)

	Holes on the plugplate are used for many purposes; not all get 
spectroscopic fibers. Some are for guide stars while other smaller holes 
trap light from bright stars. A large (0.25-inch) hole holds a coherent 
sky bundle and perhaps 10 more holes are for drilling quality control. 
The quality control holes might be a fixed pattern on every plate that 
the machinist measures to make sure things did not slip during drilling, 
for example. These must be marked before plugging.
	A viewgraph transparency generated from the PLUGPLATE DRILLING FILE 
is projected onto the plugplates so the guide star, light trap, and 
quality control holes can be manually marked. The software for printing 
the transparency is on the fiber mapper at Apache Point because this is 
the system used by the daytime plugging staff. The PLUGPLATE DRILLING 
FILE is accessed from the observer's workstation via NFS.

B. Plugplate Selection (Rich Kron)

	Survey Strategy sends to Apache Point the list of plugplates that 
should be ready for the next spectroscopic night.

C. Plugging (Bruce Gillespie)

	Daytime staff at Apache Point plug the plates.

D. Mapping (Paul Mantsch)

	After plugging, the fiber cartridge is presented to the fiber mapper, 
which matches the object name to the spectrum location on the CCD. The 
input is the PLUGPLATE DRILLING FILE and the output is the MAPPING FILE.
	The operator installs the fiber cartridge in the fiber mapper and 
types the plugplate identification number. The mapper goes to the 
observer's workstation and opens the corresponding PLUGPLATE DRILLING 
FILE (through NFS; the filename is just the plugplate ID: 002433.drl). 
It performs (or instigates on the SGI) the checksum verification to make 
sure the file hasn't been damaged or modified since it left Fermilab.
	The mapper then scans the fiber cartridge to determine which spectrum 
on the CCD corresponds to which object in the PLUGPLATE DRILLING FILE. 
It writes the MAPPING FILE to the SGI, which for the most part looks 
like the PLUGPLATE DRILLING FILE. Appended to each non-light trap object 
record are two numbers: the slithead identification and the spectrum 
number.
	Each slithead is coded with a 7-bit identification (we use a large 
number so we can track slithead modifications, dead fiber status, and 
repairs; each time we modify the slithead, we change the number). On 
each cartridge, one slithead has an even identification, the other odd. 
This identification number is appended to the object records.
	A 4-digit fiber cartridge identifier is made by combining the two 
slithead identification numbers in hex. Concatenating the two 2-digit 
hex numbers, even number last (so the LSB is always 0) makes the 4-digit 
fiber cartridge identifier. Thus, a fiber cartridge that holds slitheads 
number 5 and 10 would be called 050a.
	The mapper will also flag fibers broken during plugging. Broken or 
low throughput fibers will be immediately tied off and the object or sky 
record in the MAPPING FILE will have the DEAD flag added. This is the 
best place to deal with dead fibers because their possible locations can 
be shown on the video display and the mapper can be instructed to 
illuminate the suspects for confirmation.
	Alternatives to this procedure include a routine (monthly?) mapping 
run for dead fibers or flagging dead fibers from flat field 
observations. The dead fiber mapping run is not be sufficiently 
different from the observing mapping run to make it worthwhile. Using 
the flat field information is less reliable (what if a bug is sitting on 
a good fiber?) and requires immediate action AFTER the observation 
because the only way to find a particular fiber is by its location in a 
plugplate (even if every fiber were numbered, you wouldn't find it 
easily in a jungle of 640). Unplug the plate and you've lost the dead 
fiber information.
	Another procedure might be to accumulate statistical data with the 
mapper: "N fibers dead on this date" and wait until the N becomes large 
enough to make a difference. You'd still have to do a mapping run on a 
plugplate, but you'd concentrate the effort in one job, making the usual 
mapping run completely automatic.
	The MAPPING FILE, whose name would be 050a.map in this example, is 
written to the observer's workstation (SGI), which immediately generates 
and stores a checksum. No example is presented here, but this file looks 
just like the PLUGPLATE DRILLING FILE except that the object records 
have two additional values: the slithead ID and the spectrum number.
	When the MAPPING FILE is safely stored on the observer's workstation, 
a message is sent to Survey Strategy alerting them that the fiber 
cartridge is available for nighttime use.

E. Unplugging (Bruce Gillespie)

	When the spectroscopic observation has been obtained or the plugplate 
expires, the daytime staff removes the plugplate from the fiber 
cartridge. Notification is sent to Survey Strategy.
	
IV. Observing

A. Nightly lineup (Rich Kron)

	Before the beginning of every night, the spectroscopic lineup is 
written by the Apache Point observer. At the least, it shows the civil 
time range during which each cartridge can be used. At this time, 
existence of the related .map files should be confirmed.

B. Decide: Imaging or Spectroscopy (Rich Kron)

	The Apache Point observer decides at sunset whether the night starts 
with imaging or spectroscopy.

C. Load a cartridge (Bruce Gillespie)

	The nighttime staff selects a cartridge and latches it to the 
telescope. The latch system for the fiber cartridges is completely 
independent of the spectroscopic control system, preventing the observer 
in the control room from dropping the fiber cartridge by accident.
	If this is the first spectroscopic observation after an imaging run, 
the spectroscopic corrector must be installed. The corrector is carried 
above the plugplate on any of the ten fiber cartridges and is latched 
onto the telescope at the beginning of a spectroscopic run. It is 
removed when the imaging camera is installed.

D. Setup for calibrations and exposure (Alan Uomoto, Russell Owen)

	The observer's program (SGI) reads the fiber cartridge identification 
number from the spectrographs and opens the associated MAPPING FILE. The 
MAPPING FILE contains the plate coordinates, valid hour angles, guide 
star locations, intended temperature, etc. It passes the intended 
temperature information to the telescope and instructs it to point, 
scale, and focus for the estimated mid hour angle of the exposure.
	Simultaneously, the observer's program adjusts the spectrograph focus 
and alignment accounting for the temperature and slithead personality. 
When the telescope is ready, the flat field screen is extended and a 
short calibration lamp exposure checks the image position and focus. The 
observer examines the placement of one or two sets of emission lines on 
each CCD to make sure the spectra are properly positioned. Adjustments 
are made if necessary by moving the spectrograph collimator mirror. If 
the observer feels the need, a Hartmann exposure is made to check the 
focus and the focus is adjusted. When all is properly set up, a 
wavelength and flat field exposure set is taken and recorded at this 
telescope position.
	The observer's program then tells the telescope to retract the 
calibration screen and point to the field center. It also transmits the 
guide star coordinates to the telescope. The guider picks up the guide 
stars and the telescope is instructed to center up and start guiding.
	Strictly speaking, the telescope does not need the guide star 
coordinates. In principle, it can locate the radial position of each 
fiber on the plugplate and determine the rotation of the fiber in its 
hole through exploratory telescope motions. In practice, the image 
quality in the guide fibers will be poor and the telescope can use all 
the help it can get. By fixing the fiber plugplate coordinates, a better 
solution should be possible.
	If telescope pointing turns out not to be accurate enough to find the 
guide stars in the guide fibers, an offset from a star in the large 
coherent bundle can be done prior to setup.

E. Spectrophotometry sequence (Alan Uomoto)

	When the observer's program finds that the telescope is set up on the 
field and guiding, it begins a spectrophotometric exposure sequence. The 
observer's program moves the telescope in a 2x2 raster stopping at each 
location for a short exposure. These exposures are heavily binned and 
need not take long. These data may be used to check the photometric zero 
points against the predicted count rate (are we even close to being 
centered up?) and act as a sanity check on the centering and drilling 
algorithms.
	They will also be used to provide spectrophotometric calibrations. 
The sum of the four exposures is probably a pretty good 
spectrophotometric observation so normalizing the redshift exposures to 
this level is a first-order correction for slit losses.

F. Redshift exposure (Alan Uomoto, Russell Owen)

	The observer's program then begins the first of three spectroscopic 
exposures. While exposing, the observer's program occasionally queries 
the telescope for the following guide star information: count rate for 
each guide star, FWHM (or other seeing indicator) for each guide star, 
sky brightness from the large coherent bundle, and telescope pointing 
error. The query rate will be something like every 10-30 seconds. At the 
least, this information is reported to the observer; at best, it will be 
used to adjust automatically the exposure time.

G. Decide again

	At the end of each spectroscopic exposure a decision to stay with 
spectroscopy or change to imaging mode is made by the Apache Point 
observer. Sky condition information comes from visual inspections and 
the IR camera, which can see clouds on moonless nights, and the monitor 
telescope, which presents the transparency, extinction, and stability of 
the sky. The guide cameras on the spectrographs are useful for adjusting 
spectroscopic exposure times but are not sufficiently accurate to help 
in the imaging vs spectroscopy question.

V. Special sequences

A. Spectrograph focus

	The spectrograph is focused by comparing two discharge lamp exposures 
taken with left and right Hartmann masks in place. We expect that an 
automatic sequence will be written to determine and set the best focus.
	The spectrographs have three focus adjustments. The most important is 
the collimator to slithead distance, controlled by three motors (we can 
also aim the collimator). Each of the two spectrograph cameras also has 
a manual focus adjustment that moves the CCD with respect to the big 
lenses of the camera. During normal operations, only the collimator 
mirror adjustment is needed.

B. Dispersion curves

	The low order coefficients of the dispersion curves will be measured 
directly from the discharge lamp calibration exposures. The higher order 
coefficients are computed from high signal to noise exposures obtained 
less frequently. A set of long exposures will be obtained maybe once per 
night. These will be delivered to the spectroscopic data reduction 
system for analysis.

C. Bias exposures

	A set of bias exposures, medianed in groups of three to eliminate 
radiation hits and averaged to increase signal-to-noise, is taken at 
regular intervals. These may or may not be used in data reduction.

D. Dark exposures

	Dark exposures of 15-60 minute duration will be obtained at 
occasional intervals. These will probably not be used in data reduction.

E. Sky

	These are obtained during periods not good enough for spectroscopy 
(too much moon, poor seeing, etc.) and are compared with flat field 
exposures to check our calibration system for throughput variations, 
baffling problems, etc.

F. Scattered light

	A single bright star is sent through the spectrograph to map the 
scattered light background. This should be done every month or so to 
check for dust on the spectrograph optics, lens hazing, and changes in 
internal baffling (none of these should be a problem, but it doesn't 
take much to check).

G. Blocking

	A small bright planetary nebula (NGC 7027 comes to mind) should 
occasionally be put on the spectrograph to check the second order 
blocking. [O II] 3727 should show up in second order. If we pick a known 
spot on the nebula, we can estimate the blocking efficiency (we can't 
observe 3727 directly).

VI. Write tape (Alan Uomoto)

	At the end of the night, two DLT tapes are installed in the 
observer's workstation and a write tape routine puts FITS files on them. 
One tape is stored at Apache Point and the other is shipped to Fermilab 
the following Monday or Thursday, whichever is sooner (every day? UPS 
2nd day? FedEx next day? Priority mail? FTP?).

VII. Instrument log

	The current plan is to provide a paper notebook that resides at the 
observatory for use by the spectrograph scientist and resident 
instrument specialist. This is the most convenient record keeping system 
for those working on the instrument. There might be a need for some of 
this information to be transmitted to others, however. For example, 
broken fibers must be accounted for in the object count.
	Do we need (or want) an on-line instrument log? I can imagine a 
simple TCL window with check marks for general subject and a place to 
insert text. After working on the spectrograph, the instrument 
specialist might copy the important information from the notebook to the 
on-line log. The TCL program the writes a database entry or maybe a FITS 
file that will be recorded the next time data from the spectrograph are 
put on tape.

VIII. File formats

	Except for the spectroscopic data files, all of the above files are 
plain text. This makes it easy for the fiber mapper to read the 
PLUGPLATE DRILLING FILE and write the MAPPING FILE. The files are small 
so storage space is not a sufficient argument to use a binary format. 
The checksum will catch errors.
	Each spectroscopic exposure generates one output file per 
spectrograph in true FITS format. Each file contains data from one CCD. 
The files are written to tape using dd and a blocking factor of 10 
(28800 bytes/physical record). The FITS header:

SIMPLE  =           T
BITPIX  =          16
NAXIS   =           2
NAXIS1  =        2100
