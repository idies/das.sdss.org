<h1> Release Notes for dm </h1>

<h2>devel</h2>
Here's a list of changes made which need to be incorporated for version 1.1,
which needs to be cut before the integration.
<ul>
<li>psPlan: removed mtPatchesDir and modified mtPatches to accomodate multiple
    directories for multiple kali runs as input.
<li>exPhotom: added HDU matching observed stars in primary catalog stars.
<li>fpObjc: renamed profSig to profErr.  Changed some capitalization.
<li>idReport: added fields mu0 and nu0.
<li>psPlan: added keyword psOid.
<li>exPhotom: changed in comments for aa, bb, cc, and kk: primed ->unprimed.
<li>idReport: added keyword "ccdCamera".
<li>idReport: removed field "mjd" from the table.  Fixed up the example table
    entries.
<li>fpPlan: added keywords "ccdrow_[riuzgolts]".
<li>scParam: added keywords.
<li>exPlan: renamed keyword "version" to "setVersion", since "version"
    conflicts with the generic plan keyword of the same name.
<li>asPlan: added keyword ccdConfig, needed only for ncols and nrows.
<li>asParam: changed keyword 'thetaNcoeff' to 'thetacNcoeff'
<li>koCat: added color field
</ul>

pipelines.
<li>Object diagrams are now available from the web.
<li>Documentation has been made a little more useful.
</ul>
