<h2><a name="dm">Check Out the Data Model</a></h2>
The Data Model is maintained in the CVS module <em>dm</em>.  This module
includes a number of binary files: these include a database file which contains
the actual data model, as well as numerous diagrams.  Since we have no way of
merging two sets of changes to a binary file, only one copy of <em>dm</em>
should be checked out at any one time.  Actually, only the <em>app</em> and
<em>log</em> subdirectories contain binary files, so multiple users can check
out some of the other subdirectories (e.g., the <em>flatFiles</em>
subdirectory).

<H2><A NAME="setup">Setup</A></H2>
Paradigm Plus should be run on <EM>sdss</EM>.  It is
supported in the Fermilab UPR system, under the product name
<EM>pp</EM>.  Thus, to access the Paradigm Plus tool:
<PRE>
fncase% setup pp
</PRE>
The following environmental variables must be set before you run Paradigm
Plus.  They point to the directory which holds the Paradigm Plus project
containing the SDSS Data Model.
 <P>
For sh users:
<PRE>
export PP_INI_FILE=/usrdevel/s1/dm/.paradigm
export PP_APP_PATH=/usrdevel/s1/dm/app
export PP_LOG_PATH=/usrdevel/s1/dm/log
export PP_PGM_PATH=/usrdevel/s1/dm/pgm
</PRE>
For csh users:
<PRE>
setenv PP_INI_FILE /usrdevel/s1/dm/.paradigm
setenv PP_APP_PATH /usrdevel/s1/dm/app
setenv PP_LOG_PATH /usrdevel/s1/dm/log
setenv PP_PGM_PATH /usrdevel/s1/dm/pgm
</PRE>
Above, "/usrdevel/s1" should be substituted with the path in which
you've CVS checked-out the <em>dm</em> module.
If the file <EM>~/.pprc</EM> exists in your home directory, it will be sourced
whenever the Paradigm Plus UPR product <EM>pp</EM> is <EM>setup</EM>.  Thus, if
the above lines are included in that file, they will be declared automatically
whenever you use Paradigm Plus.

<H2><A NAME="execute">Execute</A></H2>
The Paradigm Plus executable is named <EM>paradigm</EM>.  Start it up in the
background.
<PRE>
fncase% paradigm &
</PRE>
It does not matter which directory you are in when you start up Paradigm Plus.
It takes a while for things to start up, with numerous windows opening and
closing.  Eventually, you should be looking at an object diagram.  Verify that
you are in the SDSS project; the label of all PP windows should include
the string "- sdss -".  If instead of opening up in the <em>sdss</em>
application, you are presented with an error box saying "Application file (...)
not found!", then you have probably just checked out the <em>dm</em> product
and PP doesn't know where it is.  Select <em>OK</em> in the error box, and then
from the PP menu bar select <em>File</em>, and from its menu <em>Open</em>.
You will be prompted with a file dialog box, from which you should specify
<em>dm/app/sdss.app</em> from wherever you checked-out <em>dm</em>.  The next
time you start up PP, it should find the <em>sdss</em> application.

<H2><A NAME="add">Adding a Class</A></H2>
The fundamental unit of data in the Data Model is a <def>class</def>.  A
class is a collection of <def>attributes</def>, and optionally
<def>operations</def>.  Objects are associated to other objects via
<def>associations</def>.  Thus, formally defining a set of retained data
for the survey requires the addition of one or more classes to the Data
Model.  Classes are most easily created via an Object Diagram.  
When creating classes and associations, follow the rules and suggestions
outlined in the discussion of our use of
<A HREF="pp.metaclasses.html">Paradigm Plus Metaclasses</A>.

<H2><A NAME="code">Automatic Code Generation</A></H2>
Software code may be generated automatically in various formats directly from
the Data Model.  The code is written directly to a file.  The automatically
generated code is bracketed within the file by comments of a format
recognized by the PP scripts which generate the code.  A single file may
contain many such blocks of automatically generated code.  If the code is
regenerated, only those parts of the file bracketed within the recognized
comments are replaced; the remainder of the file is maintained as is.  Thus,
after the initial code generation, the file may be added to, and these changes
will be maintained whenver the code is regenerated.  Sections of the files
contained within the PP brackets should not be edited, as these edits will be
lost the next time the code is regenerated.
 <P>
The following code formats are currently supported:
<DL>
<DT> C++ Code
<DD> C++ classes may be generated for specified classes.  The schema library to
which the class belongs must first have been checked out of CVS in the same
directory where the <em>dm</em> directory resides, as all automatic C++ code
generation occurs relative to that path.  On an object
diagram, select those classes which you wish to generate C++ code for, then
from the <EM>Run</EM> menu select <EM>C++ Code</EM>.  Those classes which have
a value specified in their <EM>Class</EM> meta-attribute
will have a C++ class
generated.  The C++ class will take the name specified in the object's
<EM>Class</EM> meta-attribute.  Two files will be created/modified:
<EM>$PP_APP_PATH/../../sourceFile/include/class.ddl</EM>, which contains
the Objectivity schema definition; and
<EM>$PP_APP_PATH/../../sourceFile/src/class.cc</EM>, which contains the
C++ implementation of the class.  In the file paths, <EM>sourceFile</EM> is
replaced with the value of the class's <EM>Source File</EM> meta-attribute,
and <EM>class</EM> is replaced with the value of the class's <EM>Class</EM>
meta-attribute.
Automatically generated code in the files is bracketed by
lines of the format:
<PRE>
//##begin ...
automatically generated code
//##end ...
</PRE>
where the ellipses are replaced with text specific to that file.
It is also
possible to list out differences between the current files, and the newly
generated files, without overwriting the files.  In other words, the newly
generated code is written to temporary files, these are diff'd against
the old files, and the temporary files are discarded without overwriting
the old files.  To perform this function, select <em>C Code</em> from
the <em>Run</em> menu.

<DT> Flat-Files
<DD> Flat-files -- either FITS files or FTCL parameter files -- may
be generated for specified classes.  On an object
diagram, select those classes which you wish to generate flat-files for, then
from the <EM>Run</EM> menu select <EM>Ada Code</EM>.  Those classes which have
a value specified in their <EM>Document</EM> meta-attribute
will have a sample flat-file
generated.  One file will be created/modified:
<EM>$PP_APP_PATH/../flatFiles/document.html</EM>, 
in which <EM>document</EM> is
replaced with the value of the class's <EM>Document</EM> meta-attribute.
Automatically generated code in the files is bracketed by
lines of the format:
<PRE>
&lt;!--##begin ... --&gt;
automatically generated code
&lt;!--##end ... --&gt;
</PRE>
where the ellipses are replaced with text specific to that file.
It is also
possible to list out differences between the current files, and the newly
generated files, without overwriting the files.  In other words, the newly
generated code is written to temporary files, these are diff'd against
the old files, and the temporary files are discarded without overwriting
the old files.  To perform this function, select <em>Smalltalk Code</em> from
the <em>Run</em> menu.
</DL>

<H2><A NAME="reorderAttributes">Reordering Attributes</A></H2>
Scripts loop over attributes in the order in which they are created.  This
order may be seen by doing an <EM>Update Lists</EM> from the
<EM>Edit</EM> menu in an
object diagram, or using the Table Viewer to list the attributes.  The order
may be changed using the "Reorder Attributes" script.  Perform the following
steps:
<OL>
<LI> Start up the Table utility, viewing attributes.
<LI> Change the value of the <EM>Key_Number</EM> field for all attributes in a
given class.  The values should be from 1 to N, where N is the number of
attributes, in the order you wish where 1 is the first attribute and N the
last.
<LI> Select the class whose attributes are to be reordered on an object
diagram.
<LI> Select <EM>Script...</EM> from the <EM>Run</EM> menu, and select the
script <EM>Reorder Attributes</EM>
</OL>

<H2><A NAME="drawRel">Draw Relationships</A></H2>
All relationships between two classes may be automatically drawn on a diagram.
Perform the following steps:
<OL>
<LI> Select the two classes whose relationships you wish to have drawn.  Only
one diagram may be open, and exactly two classes must be selected on that
diagram.
<LI> Select <EM>Script...</EM> from the <EM>Run</EM> menu, and select the
script <EM>Draw Relationships</EM>
<LI> The relationships will be drawn as exactly-one-to-exactly-one associations
with no notation.  For each relationship drawn, double click on it to open its
edit box.  Select <em>OK</em> without modifying it, and it will be redrawn with
the correct cardinality, notations, etc.
</OL>

<h2><a name="modify">Modifying a Class</a></h2>
Classes, and relationships between classes, may be modified using the usual
PP tools.  When any modifications are performed, the effects of those
modifications on the flat-file formats and C++ schema should be checked by
selecting the modified classes on a diagram and choosing the <em>C Code</em>
and <em>Smalltalk Code</em> options from the <em>Run</em> menu (which show you
the differences in the C++ schema and flat-file formats, respectively).
