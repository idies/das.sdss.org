A meeting was held at FNAL Friday August 4th to discuss 
exactly what the DA was supposed to do, and if there were tasks
the DA could not do, where these tasks would land.

This is my draft of the meeting summary, please read over and
send corrections or comments, I will then post on the sdss-web-page for
further reference.

=============
The general theme of the meeting was that closure needs to be reached
on what the DA is required to do.  We cannot continue to add
more and more tasks to the ONLINE DA (VME 68040 boards) system between
now and the time that the survey begins.  Because of CPU limitations
on the boards and because of the difficulty in getting at and modifying 
the code in the DA system, especially once it is sent to the 
mountain, it is important to define the base DA tasks well in advance.  
Also, since there will be unforeseen tasks that the DA may be called 
upon to perform as the
actual survey begins, some 'reserve CPU overhead percentage' should 
be left free for unforeseen emergency DA processing, and we will also
need a lot of flexibility during the test year.  These problems concern
only PhotoDA - the astrometricDA has plenty of capacity.

Kent reviewed the history of the DA system.  Its basic tasks are to acquire
the fata from the photometric CCDs, write them to tape, write bookkeping
and header information and perform enough real-time analysis to
monitor the data quality.  The two QA tasks currently performed are:
(1) quartile every row of data and (2) find something like 30 stars
per frame, clip postage stamps and measure the PSF.  The purpose of (1)
is to monitor sky noise and dark current and of (2) to monitor the
seeing and general image quality.  Both of these output data products are
used by the postage stamp pipeline, the quartile data for flattening and the
postage stamps for calculation of the PSF.  The combination of these derived
data products and the raw photometric frames means that the data can be
read from tape and fully processed by PHOTO in a single pass through the 
tapes.

As pipeline development has proceeded, several more outputs have been requested
from the DA.  First, Astro has requested that, rather than PhotoDA finding
bright stars and cutting postage stamps, that stamps be cut at pre-
determined locations, at the locations of _all_ stars found by AstroDA.
This would be done while the data are on disk, before writing out to tape.
Astro and Photo enthusiastically endorse this plan: it would improve
the astrometry, provide more postage stamps to Photo with more overlap
with MT standards, provide postage stamps matched in all 5 colors and
(maybe) provide more stars in the u band.  This scheme is complete overkill
for QA, though.  The code for star finding in PhotoDA could be removed.
The second request, from Photo, is for complete frames containing all 
bright stars (brighter than 7m - these are catalogue objects, and we
expect something like one every half hour), and for one large postage
stamp (200 x 200 pixels) per frame roughly every half hour, of a star
brighter than 15m but unsaturated, to characterize the PSF wings and
primary and secondary ghosts.  It was estimated that the current DA code 
uses 80 - 85% of its tuime budget, and these requests would bring the 
CPU budget over 100% unless we give up
full quartile sampling.  If one sampled the quartiles every 2nd or 3rd
or 5th row, one has more time to play with.  The general feeling, however,
was that while these undersampled quartiles were good enough for QA
purposes, they were not good enough for photo pipe reductions.
The possibility of electronic periodic noise and low signal-to-noise 
in the quartiles were the considerations.

It was noted that for about $50k-$100k the DA 68040 CPUs could
be possibly upgraded to 68060 CPUs which would run
approximately twice as fast, but this option was not readily endorsed, since
the DA code is still 'hard to get to'.

The above discussion led to the proposal that the DA tasks be essentially
fixed 'at the status quo', and that further tasks such as cutouts and
large postage stamps be handled down stream in another pipeline which
would run at FNAL on the production system.  It was shown how
this could be arranged so that the tapes still would only
need to be read once if $50k more worth of disk was purchased. If we
do not make the extra disk purchase the system could still work by
reading the tapes twice.

There were advantages and disadvantages to this new pipeline:

The main advantage was it gave more flexibility to allow fancy code and
processing to be inserted at the front end of the pipeline
system without stripping apart and rewriting the very time critical and 
hard to get at DA online system.

The main disadvantage was that it would require yet another pipeline
to be written and maintained by someone.  Pieces of the code
do exist, but it will require effort to put it together, and we are
already busy with too many other things.

Other advantages and disadvantages were discussed and a consensus was
reached (though not unanimously) that 'closing' the DA and adding this 
extra pipeline was a reasonable way to go.

Task lists for the ONLINE DA (MC68040 side of the DA), 
the IOP (unix side of DA, also known as the Imaging Observers Program), and
the new pipeline (called the Serial Stamp Collection (Pipe)line) were
drawn up, they are as follows:

A star indicates that the task is (more or less) done in the
existing software system.

A. ONLINE DA (MC68040 CPUs boards, 10 of them):
	Jon Bakken, Ron Rechenmacher, Tom Nicinski, OLS group

1. Lock the frame boundaries of the Astro CCDs to the Photo CCDs by
providing a software programmable offset of a fixed number of rows to each
rank of astrometric CCDs.   This syncs the frames read by the photo CCDs
and astro CCDs so that whole 1354 row frames from both photo and astro
cameras are seeing the same piece of sky (though at different times). Without
this syncing, the astrometric frames, for example, would see sky 
corresponding to 2/3 of one photo frame and 1/3 of the next photo frame.

*2. Quartiles for the photometric CCDs are generated with 200 histogram 
bins.  Every line is scanned (no undersampling). This is the status quo.

If it turns out that it the DA cannot do this in time, than
the quartiling is relaxed to every 5th row and these quartiles are then used
only for QA on the mountain and a separate full quartiling will be done in the
sscPipeline. This is not expected to be necessary.

*3. Up to 30 stars per photo CCD are detected independently
on each photo CCD, 29x29 postage stamps are
cut and the 'Kent' set of params (x,y,Ixx,Iyy,Ixy,...) are measured for each
of these stars.

3.1  Quartiles from 2. and stamps and params from 3. are bundled together
into a legal binary FITS Frame Gang file containing 15 HDUs (5 chips
per dewar for 3 files).  The IOP program polls the DA to
see when this gang file is ready to be transferred over to the Unix sdsshost
machine.

*4.  Up to 100 stars per Astro CCD are detected independently on
each astro CCD, 29x29 stamps are cut, 'Kent' params and 'Monet' params 
(x,y,FWHM=sigma, peak of marginal fit, ....) are measured for these stars.
These stamps and params are assembled into gang files simlilar to those
in 3.1 except they have more params and no quartiles.

4.1 Caveat:  There may be a flat field provided independently to astroline
to set the detection thresholds. It may be possible to work without a
flat field for the astrometrics.

4.2 Leading and trailing astrometrics may have some cross talk
added to cut matching stars. This code will only be added if necessary.

*5. There is no delay waiting for a whole 'FIELD' of frames to build up
before gang files can be pulled over to the IOP. The gang files
are organized on a FRAME basis and are available almost immediately
to IOP after each frame boundary is hit.

6.  If the DA hits a particularly nasty region of sky with wildly
varying sky background levels, or with zillions of stars, a situation
 still could occur where it was not possible to complete the quartiling,
postage stamp cutting and param measuring.  This is expected to
occur no more than once per 10^4 frames.  If it does occur a "NULL gang
file" with header information only, containing frame number and TCC
status values (RA, DEC, TAI, etc), will still be created so that
the IOP has a 'complete set' of gang files corresponding the
raw data frames on tape with no gaps.

7. Focus algorithm.  For a first pass, one might try to detect and
 measure params for stars which pass thru the focus chips just like
it was another astrometric chip.  The params would be stored in the
astro gang file.  Suppose the focus chips, however, are slightly out of
focus and centroid and fwhm routines may not work well. If this is
the case then special treatment will be needed for the focus chips.
This needs to be worked out. (At present the focus chips are orphans).

==============================================================
B. DA Archiver: (68040 CPUs 6 DLT tape drives)

This part of the DA waits for 5 frames corresponding to a field
to be read out.  They are sitting on the DA's disk.
The archiver then gathers the 5 frames corresponding to a field
and writes them as a group of 5 (FIELD) to a dual DLT tape drive.

Some status pool flag is then set notifying that a field has
been successfully archived.

Old frames (ones that have already been written to tape)
are then marked on the disk as 'expendable' and some
kind of circular buffer can then overwrite them with new
frames. Frame lifetime is about 20 minutes.

=============================================================

C. IOP: (Imaging Observer Program)  
	Fritz Bartlett, with assistance from Kent, Yanny, and others.

The IOP is a TCL program running on the sdsshost (SGI crimson 100MHZ)
machine on the mountain.

Its tasks are:

1. poll the 10 DA CPUs every 10 seconds, if the FRAME number counter
has been incremented, then a new gang file is ready for transfer.
Transfer that gang file over to the sdsshost disk. At the
end of the night all these gang files for a run(s) will be written 
to "the 7th DLT tape".

2. read the gang file header and append a line to a text log file
giving FRAME#, RA, DEC, TAI, IPA, IPARATE, SPA, AZ, ALT, FOCUS.
One log file per DA CPU per run.
this log file is used by QA and also by the pipelines to see which
frames occur in a given run, and where the telescope boresight
was pointing for a given frame. written to 7th tape.

3. read the gang files and plot fwhm, Ixx, Iyy , and sky brightness
of selected bright stars. Trigger an alarm if stars become too 
out of focus or too elongated or sky becomes too bright. This is a QA 
feature.

4. monitor TCC axes currents and weather,
store to log file every two minutes. allow strip charts and alarms. This
is achieved via a tcl-dp telnet connection to the TCC.

5. monitor DA camera voltages and CCD temps every minute or so,
log and alarm.  This info is in the DA status pool, and is available to IOP.

6. QA: compare leading and trailing astrometric stars from the gang files
for matches.  compare mags and positions to expected.

7. monitor focus and feedback focus changes to the TCC.

8. compare stars in the gang files to known GSC stars.

9. Send secondary patch coordinates to the Monitor telescope program (mop)
at the appropriate times.

10.  Allow starting and stopping of a run (start and stop DA side).
   start and stop TCC.

11.  Allow infrequent bringing over of full frames from the ONLINE DA
for QA purposes.  (one image every 2 minutes).

12. Allow (within limits) (off mountain) monitoring of all 
IOP variables and logs.

=====================================================================

D. Serial Stamp Collection (pipe)line:
	(a new pipeline, run on production system at FNAL)
	organizational responsibility: uncertain

1. from tape 7, read the observing logs and gang files for one run
	or set of runs from one night to disk.

2. using the observing logs and bright star catalogs, 
compute positions (frame numbers) of frames containing very bright (7th
magnitude stars). No astrometry needed beyond crude RA, DEC vs. frame
number in observing logs.

3. load a raw frames tape (1-6). run 'nextFrameGet' which reads sets 
of 5 frames (fields) and build the 200 pixel overlaps.  It holds the 
field with overlap in memory.  

4. cut photo CCD postage stamps from the field for stars corresponding
to astrometric stars read from 5 astrometric gang files. Measure Kent
and Monet (and Lupton?) params for these stars, store in a Field Gang file.
Again no astrometry is needed at this point beyond fixed camera 
CCD offsets between astro and photo CCDs.

Note that in order for the astrom pipeline to match across ccd columns
(i.e. to solve for the whole camera), all 6 tapes need to be read in 
and processed.  This means either buying quite a bit more
disk to store all the files from 6 CCD columns or alternatively
(and this is the current plan) to read the tapes twice.

4.1  Some of the ps pipeline may be inserted here at a later date
to compute running PSFs based on 4. above.

4.2 DA quartiles for the whole run be read in and interpolated over
to generate a flat field. The raw, overlap built frames may then be
flat fielded and written to disk, thus avoiding the need to store
the raw frames on disk.  This step will not be done until a later date.
For now, this SSC pipeline allows the existing PS and Frames pipeline
to run on the data without extensive changes to either the PS or 
Frames pipeline.  Enhancements such as 4.1 and 4.2 will be done 
as time permits.  4.2 requires
that the DA can measure good, not undersampled quartiles.  If the DA
cannot, then good every-pixel-sampled quartiles are generated here in
this SSC pipeline at this step.  These quartiles are then passed onto 
the PS and frames pipelines for flatfielding.

5. If the current frame contains a 7th mag star, save that frame in
5 colors and give it a special name.

6. Every half hour or so (every 30th frame?), detect a star about 15th 
magnitude (gang file can be used to pinpoint the star) and cut 
out a 200x200 pixel postage stamp in 5 colors. (in all columns?).  
output of steps 5. and 6. are used by the PS and Frames pipelines 
to model extended PSF wings of bright objects and ghosts.

7.  Write the overlapped fields to disk to avoid re-reading the tapes
a second time by the frames pipeline.  In principal a whole
run's worth of fields need to be written to disk, thus an extra $50k = 100GB?
of disk needs to be purchased to hold all this. Alternatively, one can 
also skip the overlap building and writing to disk in this 
pipeline and can read the tapes a second time in the frames pipeline.  
Both options are feasible.

=======================================================


E. Astrom pipeline runs as before on the astro  gang files plus the newly
generated cut photo gang files (step 4. in SSC line).

E2: MT pipeline runs as before.

F. PS pipeline then runs as before, alternatively many steps 
from PS pipeline may be moved to SSC line as time permits.

G. Frames pipeline then runs as before.
