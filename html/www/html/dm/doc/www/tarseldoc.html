Jeff Munn and Brian Yanny discussed flow of data into the OPDB after
the frames pipeline finished up until and through target selection.

	Steps in Target Selection

0. The Frames pipeline runs on a given RUN. The astrometric pipeline has already
generated astrometric calibrations, call them astro_calib0 for this run.
The MT pipeline has generated photometric calibrations which the ps pipeline
has applied and photoms exist for this run as well. (this last photom generating
step may actually occur after the frames pipeline has run), call this
photo_calib0.

1. The FITS tables containing the 5-color objects detected by the frames pipeline
are are stuffed into the database. Also stuffed are field_list summaries and 
imaging run summaries.

2. The astro_calib0 and photo_calib0 calibrations are stuffed into the database.
A link is make between this field_list and these (default or initial) calibrations.

3.  There exists a 'method' for each instrumental quantity which returns a calibrated
    quantity.  For instance, objects contain x,y, and apCounts for each filter.  

	One calls a method 'calc_ra' 
	with a specific astroCalib (default to astro_calib0) which returns the
       ra J2000 corresponding to x,y pixel centroids.

	One calls a method 'objectPtr->Calc_mag(photoCalib0,"r")' to get the r-band
	magnitude. 

	And so on: for the radial profiles one 
	converts counts/pixel --> mag/square(arcsec).

	There is a method which returns reddening for each object
	based on it's positions.

	Note that the calibrated quantities are calculated 'on the fly' in this fashion
	in the OPDB, and are not stored directly in the OPDB.

4. QA is run on the recently added runs. a GOOD or BAD flag set assigned in every field
in the field_list.  This QA can do things like match up objects in the overlap
with previous scans to see if they match up.

5. Links are created in the database between duplicate detections which point to the 
	same 'real' object on the sky.  This is a non-trivial operation. 
	However, it seems to be important that it get done, especially for
	the Southern Survey, where there will be 50 duplicate detections of the
	same object.  It's also important in the North.  Using the QA in 3. above, one
	should be able to tell if the astrometry is pretty close, if not, one
	should redo the astrometry.
	The astrometry should be good to 0.3 arcsecs or better,
	and so some match radius of order 0.5-1 arcsec will be fixed to
	determined matches.  There are a few pathological cases, such as pairs
	of nearby objects which may not get matched up properly, that needs to
	be especially worried about.
				
		Suppose we have two close objects, separated by 1''.
		suppose the astrometry is off by about 1''.
		Then one might link A to B' and A' to nothing and B to nothing
		instead of A to A' and B to B':
	

				Run 175, field 73:         A-B
							   |	
			      	Run 176, field 73:      A'-B'

		Instead of:

						           A--B
						           |  |
							   A'-B'

	There are also difficult cases where an object is a blend in one, and
	resolved into two objects in the other. In this case the blended object
	is linked to both of the two individual objects.

6. Select a piece of sky, a "Targeting Region", a list of fields to target-select on.

	A "Targeting Region" consists of a list of fields within that region, 
	a specific astrom_calib and a specific photo_calib.  

	This region of the sky is what used to be called a 'brick'.  In
	general it should be large enough to allow QSO target selection
	to have the information it needs about neighboring object density.

	At the very least, a method exists to determine the boundaries of the
	region that the "Targeting region" encompasses.

	QA for all fields in that region should
	have at least one 'GOOD' field for every piece of space in that region.

	One should be done imaging the sky in this region.

	Target selection is run on one or more "Targeting Region"s at a time,
	never on a 'fractional Targeting Region'.

	Export over the firewall (1st time) is done for all objects in a 
	"Targeting Region"s at one time, never on a 'fractional Targeting Region'.

	When the time comes to recalibrate astrometrically or photometrically,
	a new object called a "Calibrated Region" is created which points to
	the same list of fields, but which points to a new astrometric and/or
	photometric calibrations.
	This new "Calibrated region" can then be thrown over the firewall to 'replace'
	an existing "targeting region".  The target flags selected previously do
	not change.

7.  Set primary/secondary/repeat flags for all objects in all fields in the "Targeting Region"

	For all the fields in the targeting region, use the QA "GOOD/BAD" flags as well
	as predetermined dividing lines based on lambda,eta, l,b, mu,nu to
	set the PRIMARY/SECONDARY bits in the target_flags attribute of each object.
	
	This is a rather complex operation.
	
	The target_flags attribute for each object looks like this:

	enum arTargetFlags
{
  AR_TF_DETERMINED    = 0x00000001,  // Has this object been through the
                                     // targeting pipeline?
  AR_TF_PRIMARY       = 0x00000002,  // Primary object?
  AR_TF_REPEAT        = 0x00000004,  // Repeat object from previous field?

  AR_TF_GALAXY_CLASS  = 0x00000010,  // Galaxy according to galaxy WG?
  AR_TF_QSO_CLASS     = 0x00000020,  // Galaxy according to QSO WG?

	...
}

	The DETERMINED bit is 0 if this object has not yet been thru the
	targeting pipeline. Once this bit is set the flags PRIMARY, REPEAT,
	GALAXY_CLASS, QSO_CLASS can no longer be changed.

	The REPEAT bit is set if this is a repeat detection of an object in the
	overlap strip appended to each frame.  There is no S/N gain in
	adding together repeated detections, since these are the same bits.

	The PRIMARY bit is set if this object in this field is the one
	to target amongst all it's links to the same object, if this bit
	is not set then the object is secondary and never will be targeted.

	The GALAXY_CLASS bit is set if, based on the likelihood flags put out
	by the frames pipeline and a TBD algorithm, this object is a galaxy and
	not a star for purposes of Galaxy target selection.

	The QSO_CLASS bit is set if, based on the likelihood flags put out
	by the frames pipeline and a TBD algorithm, this object is a galaxy and
	not a star for purposes of QSO target selection. (?) Not clear
	if this is needed or not.


8.  Run the Galaxy and QSO target selection code, setting flags.

	There are fixed algorithms for selecting galaxies (based on 
	petrosian r-mag, surface brightness, flux in 3'', red-ness of object)
	to determine if an object is a galaxy. If so, set the appropriate flag:

	enum arTargetFlags
{
	...
  AR_TF_BRIGHT_GALAXY = 0x00000040,  // Bright galaxy target?
  AR_TF_RED_GALAXY    = 0x00000080,  // Faint red elliptical?
	...
}

	There are algorithms for selecting QSOs (based on
	color vs. a color cube, FIRST source matchup, etc). Apply them and set
	appropriate flags:

	enum arTargetFlags
{

  ...
  AR_TF_QSO_UVX       = 0x00000100,  // UVX QSO candidate?
  AR_TF_QSO_OUTLIER   = 0x00000200,  // Non-UVX QSO outlier candidate?
  AR_TF_QSO_RADIO     = 0x00000400,  // FIRST source?
  AR_TF_QSO_HIZ       = 0x00000800,  // High-Z QSO canidate?
	
  ...
}

       
9. Send all objects which have been targeted and not
yet tiled to tiling.  

10. Export all objects in the "Targeting Region" over the firewall (export as
FITS files with calibrated quantities). 

11.  Stellar and Serendipity working groups
	return a list of id's of targets that they would like to see targeted.
	(default and/or changing algorithms) They access through the SDBX.

	Plus they may have a default algorithm in the OPDB.

	The OPDB sets the flags on their additional targets
	plus the 'SDBX examined' flag is set.

{
...
  AR_TF_SDBX_EXAMINED = 0x00000008,  // Has SDBX examined this target?
  AR_TF_STELLAR_WG    = 0x00010000,  // Stellar WG target?
  AR_TF_SERENDIPITY_WG= 0x00020000,  // Serendipity WG target?
....
}

12. Select other targets, such as sky fibers, reddening and spectrophoto (telluric)
	standards, guide stars, bright light trap stars.

	(sky objects may have been picked by frames pipeline, a few per frame,
	stored as 'sky or mask objects' in the database).
{
  ...
  AR_TF_REDDENING     = 0x00001000,  // Reddening standard?
  AR_TF_SPECTROPHOTO  = 0x00002000,  // Spectrophotometric standard?
  AR_TF_LIGHT_TRAP    = 0x00004000,  // Light-trap star?
  AR_TF_GUIDE_STAR    = 0x00008000,  // Guide star?
  AR_TF_SKY           = 0x00040000,  // Sky?
...
};


13.  Final target list.  Merge all target candidates. 
	Resolve conflicts with 55'' separation.
	
	Come up with final targeting list.
	Set a final targeting flag:
	
  {
   ...
  AR_TF_FINAL_TARGET  = 0x00080000,  // Final Target?
  AR_TF_TOO_CLOSE     = 0x00100000,  // Rejected, too close to another Target?
  AR_TF_TOO_MANY      = 0x00200000,  // Rejected, too many of these already?
  AR_TF_REJECTED      = 0x00400000,  // Rejected, for some other reason?

14.  Pass on final targeting list to plate drilling task...
