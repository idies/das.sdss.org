<PRE>

Here is the latest 'official' list of file name conventions.
Pay particular attention to the prefix convention we are proposing
(facility name prefix + file_name_similar_to_what_currently_exists)

we need a rep from each pipeline:

astrom: jrp
photo: gk
mt: annis
ts: skent
spectro: yanny

to approve this, send me mail if it's ok or what changes you need.
These file names will be enforced for the database integration to the
pipelines currently scheduled for november 1995.

This page will be kept on the web as:
http://www-sdss.fnal.gov:8000/dm/flatFiles/filenames.html
and will be regarded as the official document, changes will occur here
and be pipelines will be notified when file names affecting them change.
If the pipeline wants to change a file name, send mail to yanny@sdss.fnal.gov.

Since multiple pipelines read these files it's important to follow 
the file name conventions and notify me when things change.

1.  All files used by pipelines will use this convention: data files, 
parameter files, catalog files, log files, and any other files read
or written by pipelines

2.  A file name has the following form:

	body.suffix

where
	suffix indicates the format of the file
		fit -- FITS standard, either an image or table
		par -- a parameter file, which can be read with inipar 
		cat -- DWH catalog file 
		log -- free-form ascii produced by pipelines as a log file
		dat -- any other custom format

and
	body describes the content of the file.

3.  The body of a file may be a simple description of what the file is
for.  A parameter file that runs a pipline, for example, could be called

	asParam.par

4.  When a sequence of files is used, the body can take the following form:

	prefix-runNumber-location-sequenceNumber

where
	prefix indicates what is in the file

	runNumber is a six digit zero padded number (000123, for example)

	location is two characters indicating location, for example
		11 -- first row, first column of imaging camera
		56 -- fifth row, sixth column of imaging camera
		00 -- monitor telescope CCD
		c1 -- the first column of CCDs
	        r6 -- the 6th row of CCDs (astrometric)

	sequenceNumber is a four digit zero padded number (0789, for example)
		it can indicate frame number or field number.


Here is a list of proposed prefixes.  A central listing available
via www will be maintained as new file prefixes are created.

Facility prefixes:

	id    	Imaging DA
	md	Montitor Telescope DA
	sd      Spectroscopic DA
	sc      Serial Stamp Collecting pipeline
	mt      Monitor Telescope pipeline
	as      Astrometry pipeline 
	ps	Postage Stamp pipeline
	fp	Frames Pipeline
	ts	Target Selection
	sp	SpectroScopic pipeline


	File name prefixes (outputs interchanged between pipelines)

                fpC -- corrected image
                fpBIN -- binned image
                fpM -- image mask
                fpKO -- known objects (may be several types, FIRST, BRIGHT)
                fpN -- noise mask
                fpObjc -- object lists (OBJC)
		fpAtlas -- Atlas images

		tsPlan -- plan file (.par)
		tsParam -- param file (.par)
		tsPhotom -- final photometric solution

		spLinelist -- List of detected and measured lines

	The body may optionally use the sequenceNumber, location, runNumber,
	and prefix.   

	Other approved numerical identifiers may also be used.  Target 
	selection, for example, uses stripe, strip, and	scanline oriented 
	files with appropriate numbering.

	Examples: 

	Original images from the i chip in column 3 for run 123 are named as
	idR-000123-23-0000.fit, idR-000123-23-0001.fit, ....

	Data that is for all the fields of all the CCDs in column 1 of run 
	number 123 would have a file name idFieldInfo-000123-c1.fit

	Data for the entire run needs only the run number:  mtPhotom-049993.fit
	(mt run number is int(MJD))
