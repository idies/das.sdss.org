<h1> File format standards</h1>
<html>

Steve Kent, Jeff Munn and Brian Yanny sat down and discussed briefly some
standards for input/output files to follow.  Here is a list of 
standards that we came up with.

<p>
1. All files interchanged between pipelines shall be in FITS format or in the
form of ASCII parameter files.  Large or complex amounts of data shall be 
interchanged as FITS binary tables. Image data shall be in the form of FITS 
images files.  Parameter files may have a header section with 'keyword value'
pairs as well as 0 or more 'table' sections with free format tables following
a format like that described in the param2Chain utility in astrotools.


<p>
2. In FITS binary tables, for all pipelines and processing beyond the DA system,
the FITS standard shall be followed rigorously.  This implies that
unsigned 8-bit, signed 16-bit and signed 32-bit quantities in network byte
order shall be the internal representation of integers in FITS tables.
unsigned 16-bit data shall be accommodated using the BSCALE/BZERO or TZERONNN
mechanisms provided in FITS.

<p>
3. The PDU (primary data unit) header shall be used to store keywords which
may be thought of as being appended to every entry of a table in all the following
HDU (header data unit) tables in a file.  For instance if a FITS file has
information exclusively about a specific imaging RUN, that RUN number shall
be placed in the PDU for that FITS file and be assumed to apply to each
element of every HDU in the file.  Similarly if a quantity appears in a HDU
header (such as CAMROL or CAMCOL), that quantity applies to each table entry
in the same HDU.

<p>
4. When fixed arrays of structures are flattened out to be tables each
field within the structure should become a fixed array.

	For example: if a structure in memory looks like:
<pre>
		typedef struct {
			short x,y;
			int  apflux;
		} DETECTION;
		
		DETECTION object[5];
</pre>

	where an object is 5 detections,
	object should be flattened to:

<pre>
	TFORM1   '5I'
	TTYPE1  'x'
	TFORM2   '5I'
	TTYPE2  'y'
	TFORM3   '5J'
	TTYPE3  'apflux'

	rather than:

	TFORM1   '1I'
	TTYPE1  'x'
	TFORM2   '1I'
	TTYPE2  'y'
	TFORM3   '1J'
	TTYPE3  'apflux'
	TFORM4   '1I'
	TTYPE4  'x2'
	TFORM5   '1I'
	TTYPE5  'y2'
	TFORM6   '1J'
	TTYPE6  'apflux2'
	TFORM7   '1I'
	TTYPE7  'x3'
	TFORM8   '1I'
	TTYPE8  'y3'
	TFORM9   '1J'
	TTYPE9  'apflux3'
	TFORM10   '1I'
	TTYPE10  'x4'
	TFORM11   '1I'
	TTYPE11  'y4'
	TFORM12   '1J'
	TTYPE12  'apflux4'
	TFORM13   '1I'
	TTYPE13  'x5'
	TFORM14   '1I'
	TTYPE14  'y5'
	TFORM15   '1J'
	TTYPE15  'apflux5'
</pre>

<p>
5. Compression
	
	Compression standards are a tricky issue.  

<p>
	In cases where the data under 
	consideration is to be kept on spinning disk and where it is
	so large and compressible that not compressing it would be 
	expensive (>$50000), then a compressed form of storage which
	does not exactly follow FITS standard may be considered.

<p>
	Atlas images are one place where compress may be considered.
	Also run-length encoded bad-pixel masks.
	
<p>
	If we are keeping any corrected frames on spinning disk, some
	compressed format may be considered.

<p>
	If atlas images are kept on disk, we suggest keeping them
	in fits format where the header section of the
	file is legal fits and the heap section of the file
	is used to store the compressed bytes.  A stand alone algorithm
	(a filter subroutine written entirely in ANSI C) shall be used
	to decompress the string of heap bytes and turn it into a 
	postage stamp or mask.  It has also been recommended that
	all related postage stamp (all 5 filters for one object and all
	masks for one object) be stored as a contiguous memory chunk
	in the heap section of the FITS file.  The header section
	of the fits file shall be ordered and 'seekable' so that 
	any particular object's heap data may be accessed quickly 
	with two seeks to disk.

<p>

	Other possibilities for compression are rice compression of the data
	portion of an image which is then stored as a big heap block appended
	to a legal fits format header. This would be used for compressing
	corrected frames.

<p>
	A third possibility is to push the whole fits file, header and data
	alike thru the unix compress (.Z) filter (which appears to be better
	than .gz for compressing image data ???) and saving the file
	to disk as filename.fit.Z.
