<H1>Metaclasses</H1>
Below is described our use of the various meta-attributes of the important
Paradigm Plus metaclasses.  When creating or modifying instances of these
metaclasses, meta-attributes must be set in accordance with their description
below.

<H2><A NAME="Class">Class</A></H2>
<DL>
<DT> Name
<DD> Common descriptive name, as it appears on diagrams and in reports
     (e.g., <EM>Report</EM>).  This name is used when automatically generating
     code, primarily when naming relation attributes in C++ code, and
     when generating flat files.  As such, the following rules should be
     followed when creating a name: it should be singular; each individual
     word should be capitalized; words should be separated by a space.
<DT> Class
<DD> Controls whether or not a C++ class is generated for this class.
     If a name is specified, then that name is used as the name of the C++
     class (e.g., <EM>arReport</EM>).  Thus, its name must follow survey C++
     class naming rules, including the requirement that it start with the
     prefix <EM>ar</EM>.  If no name is specified, then a C++ class will not be
     generated for this file; when generating C++ code for other classes with
     relations to this class, no C++ link attributes to this class
     will be generated.
<DT> Prefix
<DD> Ignored.
<DT> Document
<DD> Controls whether flat-file documentation is generated for this class.
     If a file name is specified, then flat-file documentation (i.e., the
     result of running "ADA Code") is put in that file
     (e.g., <EM>report.html</EM>).  If
     blank, then no flat-file documentation is generated.  The file name should
     not contain any path.  The file will be created/modified in the
     directory <EM>$PP_APP_PATH/../flatFiles</EM>. 
<DT> Source File
<DD> If C++ code is generated for this class (i.e., a value is specified for
     its <EM>class</EM> meta-attribute), then this specifies the name of the
     schema library to which it belongs (e.g., <EM>adminSch</EM>).  Ignored
     otherwise.
<DT> Space Complexity
<DD> Ignored.
<DT> Container
<DD> Ignored.
<DT> Parameters
<DD> Ignored.
<DT> Constraints
<DD> Ignored.
<DT> Description
<DD> Brief description, which will appear in reports.  If C++ code is
     generated, then in the source <EM>*.ddl</EM>
     file, the description of the class is contained as a consecutive
     sequence of comment lines immediately following the first line in the
     class declaration (e.g., after <EM>class arPerson</EM>) but before
     <EM>{</EM>).  If the <EM>*.ddl</EM> file already exists and contains
     such a description, then that description is copied over to the new
     <EM>*.ddl</EM> file.  Otherwise, the brief description contained in this
     meta-attribute is written to the <EM>*.ddl</EM> as the description.
<DT> Type
<DD> Used only for automatic C++ code generation.
    <DL>
    <DT> Concrete
    <DD> A C++ class which may have its own instance objects.
    <DT> Abstract
    <DD> A C++ abstract base class.  There may be no instance objects for
         this class, though there may be for its subclasses.
    </DL>
<DT> Visibility
<DD> If set to <EM>PRIVATE</EM>, then a struct is created when generating
     C++ code.  Otherwise, a class is created.
<DT> Persistence
<DD> Used only for automatic C++ code generation.
     Set to <EM>Persistent</EM> if instance objects will be stored in
     the database (i.e., this is a persistent-capable class).
    <DL>
    <DT> Transient
    <DD> Not persistent-capable.
    <DT> Persistent
    <DD> Persistent-capable.
    </DL>
<DT> Concurrency
<DD> Ignored.
<DT> Cardinality
<DD> This only affects generation of tables in "ADA" code.  It sets the 
     hierarchy depth which is included as a field in the table.  Normally this
     should be set to 0 (include all parameters with a hierarchy depth >= 0).
     If set to 1, then all parameters with a hierarchy depth >= -1 are
     included.  If set to N, then all parameters with a hierarchy depth >= -2
     are included.
<DT> Division
<DD> Used to determine what type of flattened file to associated with instances
     of this class.
    <DL>
    <DT> Passive
    <DD> FITS binary table.
    <DT> Active
    <DD> FITS file.
    <DT> Subsytem
    <DD> FTCL parameter table file.
    <DT> Terminator
    <DD> FTCL parameter file.
    </DL>
<DT> User Interface
<DD> Ignored.
<DT> Derived
<DD> Ignored.
<DT> Design
<DD> When generating a FITS header or FITS binary table, skip the PDU if this
     is true.  When generating an FTCL table, skip the header keywords.
     Otherwise ignored.
<DT> Link
<DD> If selected, then when flattening, print out secondary attributes for
secondary associations only if they are directly connected to the class or
one of its participations or generalizations.  If not selected, then print
out secondary attributes for associations no matter how many links removed
they are from the class.
<DT> Metaclass
<DD> If selected, then when flattening, rather than printing only the key
attributes for participations, print all of the attributes.
Otherwise ignored.
<DT> Utility
<DD> If selected, then when flattening, swap the "field" and "filter" fields.
Otherwise ignored.
</DL>

<H2><A NAME="Attribute">Attribute</A></H2>
<DL>
<DT> Name
<DD> Descriptive name (e.g., <EM>declination</EM>).
     If its value is "id", and the <EM>Attribute</EM> field is blank, then when
     flattening the class this attribute's name is changed from "id" to the
     last word in the class name.
<DT> Attribute
<DD> Attribute name in flat files.  If blank, then it is set to the
     value of the <EM>Name</EM> field.
<DT> Document
<DD> The units for the attribute.  In the special case of an enumerated type,
     then this is ignored as a unit.  Rather, for enumerated types this is used
     only when generating FITS binary tables.  In a FITS binary table, an enum
     is listed as a character string.  This field should specify the length of
     the character string; i.e., it should specify the width of the ascii field
     in the FITS binary table.  If <em>Domain</em> is set, the units refer to
     the public units, not the units for the internal storage (see the
     description of <em>Domain</em>).
<DT> Type
<DD> Data type of the attribute (e.g., <EM>float64</EM>).
     The values listed below have special meaning;
     any other value is assumed to be a class or enum.
    <DL>
    <DT> STRING
    <DD> A persistent character string.  This will be mapped to Objectivity's
         <EM>ooVString</EM>.
    <DT> TIME
    <DD> A time, accurate to a second.  This will be mapped to a time class.
    <DT> uint8, int16, uint16, int32, uint32, float32, float64, char
    <DD> Any of the Objectivity primitive datatypes (unsigned one byte
	 integers; unsigned and signed two and four byte integers; 4 and 8
	 byte floating point numbers; one byte character).
    </DL>
     If <em>domain</em> is set (i.e., you want to store a scaled integer
     representation of the value), then this must be set to <em>float32</em>.
     See the description of <em>domain</em>.
<DT> Size
<DD> The number of elements if this is an array.  If blank, then it is not
     an array.
<DT> Initial Value
<DD> When printing out a flat-file, this is used as a sample value.  This is
     intended to be used to indicate the desired precision.  For example, if
     printing out a declination in degrees, this value might be
     <em>XXX.XX</em>.  Default sample values are used if nothing is entered
     here.  Otherwise ignored.
<DT> Description
<DD> A description.  This will be printed in reports, and in the source
     *.ddl file as a comment for the declared attribute.  Further, if
     <EM>get</EM> or <EM>set</EM> methods are automatically generated for this
     attribute, then this description will be used as the description of that
     method, with its first letter forced to be in lowercase, and either "Get "
     or "Set " prepended.
<DT> Scope
<DD> Its scope as defined within its C++ class.  Valid values are
     <EM>PUBLIC</EM>, <EM>PRIVATE</EM>, and <EM>PROTECTED</EM>.  The value
     <EM>IMPLEMENTATION</EM> means to exclude it in its C++ class, but treat
     it normally in flat files.
<DT> Key
<DD> Used when flattening a class.  If set to "PRIMARY", then this attribute
     is treated as an identifying attribute.  Ignored otherwise.
<DT> No.
<DD> Ignored.
<DT> Domain
<DD> Scale factor between the internal value and the public value.  If blank,
     then the scale factor is 1, and no conversion is made.  If set to a
     number, then the public data type (i.e., arguments to C++ methods and
     values in flat files) is <em>float32</em>, but the internal storage
     type (i.e., the data tpye of the C++ attribute) is <em>int16</em>.  The
     value stored internally (in the C++ attribute) is equal to the public
     value times the number specified in <em>Domain</em>.  Here's an example.
     You've measured the FWHM of a star in pixels.  The measured value is of
     data type <em>float32</em>, but to save space in the database you store
     the FWHM * 100 as an <em>int16</em> (i.e., you're storing the FWHM
     measured in hundreths of a pixels).
     Then <em>Type</em> = <em>float32</em>,
     <em>Domain</em> = 100, and <em>Document</em> = "pixels".  The value stored
     in flat files, as well as all C++ method arguments, will be the FWHM in
     pixels as a floating point number.
<DT> User Interface
<DD> Ignored.
<DT> Static
<DD> If set, declare this a static attribute within the C++ class definition.
     Since this isn't allowed for persistent classes, this should probably
     never be set.
<DT> Constant
<DD> Do not print out this attribute in flatfiles, but otherwise treat it
     normally in C++ code.
<DT> Derived
<DD> Ignored.
<DT> Readable
<DD> If set, an accessor method will be automatically generated within the
     C++ class definition (e.g., <EM>float64 declination() const;</EM>).
<DT> Writable
<DD> If set, a set method will be automatically generated within the
     C++ class definition
     (e.g., <EM>void setDeclination(float64 declination);</EM>).
<DT> Exclusive
<DD> In flat files, always put this attribute in the PDU or param file header.
<DT> Bound
<DD> The data type is an enumerated type, and is treated as such in
     the code generation.
</DL>

<H2><A NAME="Relation">Relation</A></H2>
Relations should be created such that the source class and destination
class reflect the direction of the relation.  For example, a
<EM>Report</EM> is authored by one or more <EM>Person</EM>s.  The
relation which captures this relation would then have <EM>Report</EM>
as the source class and <EM>Person</EM> as the destination class.  For
uni-directional classes, the link would then be part of the source class in
the C++ class definition.
<DL>
<DT> Name
<DD> Name as it appears on diagrams.  Not used in code generation.
<DT> Source
<DD> Source of the relation.  This field can not be set by the user (it is
     automatically set when the relation is graphically created).
<DT> Destination
<DD> Destination of the relation.  This field can not be set by the user (it is
     automatically set when the relation is graphically created).
<DT> Role-1
<DD> If specified, used as the name of the link attribute in the destination
     class (if a bi-directional relation).
<DT> Role-2
<DD> If specified, used as the name of the link attribute in the source
     class.
<DT> Multiplicity-1
<DD> Determines the multiplicity of the relation at the source end.
<DT> Multiplicity-2
<DD> Determines the multiplicity of the relation at the destination end.
<DT> Constraint-1
<DD> If this is an array in a FITS binary table (i.e., <EM>Container-1</EM>
     includes the keyword <EM>ARRAY</EM>) and an integer is specified here,
     then the array lengths are set to this value.  Otherwise ignored.
<DT> Constraint-2
<DD> Ignored.
<DT> Container-1
<DD> If specified, used as the datatype of the relation attribute for the
destination class.  If the datatype has an array specifier appended to it
(e.g., [10]), then it is treated as an array.
If of the form "-&gt;class", then the source class of the
relation is replaced with "class" during source code generation.  This occurs
after all keywords have been stripped from the field.
By default, all relations are bi-directional.  If this field contains the
keyword <EM>UNI</EM>, then this relation will be uni-directional, pointing
only from the source class to the destination class.  The following additional
keywords are used only when flattening (except for <EM>UNI</EM>):
     <DL>
     <DT> PRIMARY
     <DD> This relation is a primary key for the source class
	  (ignored for aggregations).
     <DT> SECONDARY
     <DD> This relation is a secondary key for the source class
	  (ignored for aggregations).
     <DT> UP
     <DD> Following this relation causes the hierarchy level to be
	  decremented by an additional 1 (normally there is no hierarchy change
	  across relations and "one-only" participations, while there is
	  a decrement of 1 across "many" participations).
     <DT> UP2
     <DD> Following this relation causes the hierarchy level to be
	  decremented by an additional 2 (normally there is no hierarchy change
	  across relations and "one-only" participations, while there is
	  a decrement of 1 across "many" participations).
     <DT> FIXED
     <DD> Used only for aggregations.  When creating a FITS binary table,
          store this aggregation as a series of arrays, creating a fixed-length
	  list for each attribute.  If an integer value is specified for
	  <EM>Container-1</EM>, or if "FIXED" is appended with an integer
	  contained in paraenthesis (e.g., "FIXED(5)"), then the array
	  lengths are set to that value;  else the array lengths will be set
	  to #.
     <DT> HEAP
     <DD> Used only for aggregations.  When creating a FITS binary table,
          store this aggregation on the heap, creating a variable-length
	  list for each attribute.
     <DT> UNI
     <DD> This is a unidirectional relation.  A link attribute is created only
	  for the source class.  By default, all relations are bi-directional.
     </DL>
<DT> Container-2
<DD> If specified, used as the datatype of the relation attribute for the
source class.  If of the form "-&gt;class", then the target class of the
relation is replaced with "class" during source code generation.
<DT> Description
<DD> Ignored.
<DT> Mandatory
<DD> By default, <EM>get</EM> and <EM>set</EM> functions are generated only
for the source class.  If this box is checked, then they are also generated
for the destination class.  This is only valid for bi-directional relations.
<DT> Derived
<DD> If checked, do not generate C++ code for this relation.
<DT> Static
<DD> If checked, create this as a non-inline relation.
<DT> Friend
<DD> If checked, create a <EM>get</EM> method.
<DT> Virtual
<DD> If checked, create a <EM>set</EM> method.
</DL>

<H2><A NAME="Operation">Operation</A></H2>
The return types and argument types may take the following special values,
which will be substituted with an implementation specific type: DATE,
TIME, VARRAY&lt;class&gt; (variable-size array).

<DL>
<DT> Name
<DD> Name as it appears on diagrams and reports.
<DT> Operation
<DD> For constructors only, used to continue the list of arguments if they
     don't fit in <EM>Formal Parameters</EM>.  For all other operations,
     the name of associated method.  If not set, then <EM>name</EM> is used.
<DT> Documentation
<DD> Used to continue the list of arguments if they don't fit in
     <EM>Formal Parameters</EM> and <EM>Source File</EM>.
<DT> Source File
<DD> Used to continue the list of arguments if they don't fit in
     <EM>Formal Parameters</EM>.
<DT> Return Type
<DD> For constructors only, used to continue the list of arguments if they
     don't fit in <EM>Formal Parameters</EM>.  For all other operations,
     the return type for the method.
<DT> Formal Parameters
<DD> The argument list for the method.  If it doesn't all fit here, then
     continue it in the fields <EM>Source File</EM> and <EM>Documentation</EM>
     (in that order).  For constructors only, it may be continued in the
     fields <EM>Return Type</EM>, <EM>Source File</EM>, <EM>Documentation</EM>,
     <EM>Operation</EM>, <EM>Reads</EM>, <EM>Changes</EM>, <EM>Sends</EM>,
     and <EM>Assumes</EM> (in that order).  If continued in other fields,
     then the contents of the other fields are appended to the argument string,
     in the order listed above.  A continuation field may be skipped, and
     the later fields in order will still be appended.
<DT> Description
<DD> Printed out as a descriptive comment in the include file, under the
     method declaration.
<DT> Read
<DD> For constructors only, used to continue the list of arguments if they
     don't fit in <EM>Formal Parameters</EM>.  Otherwise ignored.
<DT> Change
<DD> For constructors only, used to continue the list of arguments if they
     don't fit in <EM>Formal Parameters</EM>.  Otherwise ignored.
<DT> Send
<DD> For constructors only, used to continue the list of arguments if they
     don't fit in <EM>Formal Parameters</EM>.  Otherwise ignored.
<DT> Assume
<DD> For constructors only, used to continue the list of arguments if they
     don't fit in <EM>Formal Parameters</EM>.  Otherwise ignored.
<DT> Time
<DD> Ignored.
<DT> Space
<DD> Ignored.
<DT> Scope
<DD> Sets the C++ scope under which the method is declared.  The
     value <EM>implementation</EM> is ignored.
