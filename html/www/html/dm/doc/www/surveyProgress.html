<h1>Tracking the Progress of the Imaging Survey</h1>

<STRONG>WARNING: This is a document in progress.  This has not all been
thoroughly thought through yet.  This should be pretty close to the final
system.</STRONG>
<p>
We require some mechanism for tracking the progress of the imaging survey
across the sky; i.e., declaring that we have detected the astronomical objects
in a chunk of sky, and declaring which objects in the database represent those
astronomical objects.  This describes how we will do so, drawing largely on
previous SDSS documents, as well as Steve Kent's initial implementation of
the Target Selection Pipeline.

<h2><a name="concepts">Concepts</a></h2>

<h3><a name="field">Field</a></h3>

While imaging data for a given column of CCDs in the camera is acquired as a
continous drift scan, it is process as individual fields.  The strip of data
is divided into fields of 1361 rows by 2048 columns.  An additional 128 rows
from the previous field is appended as overlap.


<h3><a name="scanline">Scanline</a></h3>

The survey observing strategy leads to a natural carving of the sky into
scanlines.  A scanline is defined as that portion of the sky covered by a
single column of the imaging camera while scanning along either the north or
south strip of a single stripe.  Each scanline overlaps at least one other
scanline on either side.  For example, scanline 6 in the north
strip of stripe 3 overlaps scanline 6 in the south strip of stripe 3 and
scanline 1 in the south strip of stripe 4.  Towards the poles of the survey
area, three or more scanlines may overlap in a given area of sky.
<p>
Here we refine the definition of scanline to provide a one-to-one mapping from
sky to scanline.  Stripes are predefined great circles laid out on the sky
before any actual drift scan observations are performed.  One can similarly
predefine the area of sky which maps onto a scanline.  This requires
assumptions on the Image Camera geometry, as well as on the accuracy with which
each drift scan tracks its strip, however a substantial error in these
assumptions may be tolerated due to the overlap between scanlines.
We now have predefined scanlines which overlap.
In regions of overlap, we split the regions
in the obvious way, assigning equal areas of the overlap regions to each
scanline.  We are then
left with non-overlapping scanlines which completely cover the survey area,
yielding a one-to-one mapping from sky to scanline in the survey area.
Throughout this document, the term <em>scanline</em> will refer to these
predefined non-overlapping chunks of sky.

<h3><a name="object">Object</a></h3>

An <em>object</em> is a single detection, in all five filters, of an
<em>astronomical object</em> (i.e., star, galaxy, asteroid; hereafter AO) in
the Frames Pipeline.  A given AO may be detected numerous times over the
course of the survey, thus giving rise to several <em>objects</em> for a given
AO.  Causes for such multiple detections include:
<ul>
  <li>The Frames Pipeline is fed frames such that adjacent frames overlap
      by 128 rows.  All AOs within those overlap rows should
      be detected twice, thus yielding two separate objects each.  While
      these objects should be exactly the same within the errors, comparing
      these multiple detections provides useful quality analysis internal to
      a Frames Pipeline Run.
  <li>Fields within adjacent strips overlap by some variable amount, thus
      leading to multiple detections of AOs, and thus multiple
      objects.
  <li>A given piece of a strip may be scanned multiple times for a variety of
      reasons: quality tests, unacceptable data from the first scan, or for
      scientific reasons as in the Southern Survey.
  <li>A given Drift Scan may be processed multiple times by the Frames
      Pipeline, leading to multiple objects for each AO (more specifically,
      multiple objects for a single observation of an AO).  This will
      happen certainly during the test year, and perhaps later as well if we
      end up reprocessing all or some of the data one or more times.
</ul>
While a given AO may be detected and parameterized as an object
numerous times in the course of the survey, we must choose one such object
for each AO to serve as the <em>primary</em> object of that
AO; i.e., the catalog entry for that AO will come from that
object, target selection will use that object, all science requiring only a
single detection for a given AO will use that object, etc.
Each <em>object</em> is thus characterized by the following two attributes
which specify its status in the survey:
<dl>
  <dt>Status
  <dd>This specifies whether the object is considered a <em>primary</em>
      object in the survey; i.e., the primary detection for a given
      AO.  It may have one of the following values:<p>
      <dl>
	<dt>undetermined
	<dd>Its status has not yet been determined.
	<dt>DUPLICATE
	<dd>This object matches another object detected in an adjacent field
	    in the same Frames Pipeline Run.  It must therefore be located
	    in the overlap region between the two fields.  In this case, one
	    of the two objects is assigned this status.  Objects with
	    this status are not used for any scientific purposes, but rather
	    are only used for quality analysis internal to a given Frames
	    Pipeline Run.
	<dt>primary
	<dd>This is the primary detection of the AO for the survey.
	    All science which requires only a single detection of an
	    AO will use this object.  Target selection will use this
	    object.
	<dt>secondary
	<dd>This is a secondary detection of the AO.  This object is
	    matched up to at least one other object which serves as the
	    primary detection.  No science which requires only a single
	    detection of a AO will use this object.  Target selection
	    will not use this object, except for those aspects which examine
	    variability (e.g., serendipity).  The object may be used for
	    science which requires multiple detections of AOs
	    (e.g., variability studies), as well as for quality analysis.
      </dl>
  <dt>Target
  <dd>Is this object a spectroscopic target?  Only primary objects may be
      spectroscopic targets.
</dl>
      
Clearly we must be able to match up multiple detections/objects of the same
AO before we can perform much quality analysis, select out primary
objects, or perform target selection.  Such matches will not always be
one-to-one between two given Frames Pipeline Runs; e.g., two or more objects
may be differentiated in one Frames Pipeline Run but blended together as one
object on another.  Various algortihms may be used for matching.  For example,
two objects could be considered to match (i.e., are
considered two detections of the same AO) if the measured center
of one object falls within the effective area of the other (as determined by
its atlas image).  This should be a rigorous, unambiguous, but CPU-intensive
criterion.  A simpler criterion is that two objects match if their centers lie
within 1 arcsec of each other.  The choice of a matching algorithm is a detail
(albeit an important one) which does not affect the stucture for tracking
survey progress and target slection presented here.
<p>
The assignment of primary/secondary status would be simplified if we could
first uniquely assign an AO to a given scanline.  However, this is not
possible.  In the case of AOs which are close to the border between two
scanlines, different detections/objects for the same AO may fall in different
scanlines due to random errors in the astrometric calibrations or measured
instrumental positions, blending of objects in one Frames Pipeline Run but not
the other, etc.  Even for a given object, a new astrometric calibration may
move it from one scanline to another.

<h3><a name="object list">Object List</a></h3>

Objects are created by the Frames Pipeline.  
Each <em>Frames Pipeline Run</em> (hereafter FPR) targets a contiguous set
of fields in a single column of the Imaging Camera for a single Drift Scan,
detecting and parameterizing all objects in each field.  The natural way
to select primary objects would be to select all objects from a given
Frames Pipeline Run, which fall within the scanline being tracked by that
camera column for that run.  Since the data quality may vary over the course
of a Drift Scan, this set of objects would be limited to one or more ranges of
survey "longitude" in which the data is considered acceptable.  Here again, we
encounter ambiguity in whether a given AO near the start or end of a
range of survey "longitude" falls within that range or not.
<p>
The Frames Pipeline has been designed to work on a single field at a time.
Astrometric and photometric calibrations are quantized in units of fields.
Thus, it is natural to replace the idea of a range of survey "longitude" with
a contiguous set of fields.
This leads us to the concept of the <em>Object List</em> (hereafter OL).
An OL is the list of objects detected in a single field in a single run of the
Frames Pipeline.  Note that there is not a one-to-one mapping of OL to field;
there may be multiple OLs for a given field, one for each time the Frames
Pipeline ran on a given camera column for a given Drift Scan.
<p>
An OL serves as the fundamental quanta of data for tracking the progress of the
imaging survey; i.e., for declaring which chunks of sky have been observed
under acceptable conditions, and for which spectroscopic targets have been
chosen.  Each OL can be thought of as mapping onto a contiguous piece of a
scanline, being simply the the intersection of the field and the scanline
which it tracks.  A given chunk of scanline may be mapped to multiple OLs for
the following reasons:
<ul>
  <li>Fields within a given Drift Scan overlap, and thus so do their
      associated OLs.
  <li>A given field in a given Drift Scan may have been processed through the
      Frames Pipeline more than once, leading to multiple OLs associated with
      that field, and thus that piece of scanline.  Note that the different
      OLs may not map onto exactly the same piece of scanline (though very
      nearly the same), if they use different astrometric calibrations.
X  <li>A given piece of scanline may have been scanned by more than one Drift
      Scan.  In this case, OLs from different Drift Scans may overlap the
      same piece of scanline.
</ul>
We thus need to be able to declare which OL represents that piece of scanline
for the basic survey.  By <em>basic survey</em>, we mean the survey which
requires exactly one detection/object for each AO.  An OL which is part of the
basic survey we will call a <em>primary</em> OL.  An OL which it not part of
the basic survey we will call a <em>secondary</em> OL.  We will also use OLs
to quantize the quality of the data, as well as state of target selection.
Thus, each OL is characterized by the following four attributes which fully
specify its status in the survey:
<dl>
  <dt>Quality
  <dd>The quality of the data, in terms of its acceptability to the survey.
      This quality applies to all objects in the
      list (although flags set for individual objects by the Frames Pipeline
      may provide additional information; e.g., this object is contaminated
      with a cosmic ray, overlaps a border of the field, etc).  A given
      OL is assigned one of the following qualities:<p>
      <dl>
	<dt>undetermined
	<dd>A quality has not yet been assigned.
	<dt>useless
	<dd>The data is of such poor quality as to be useless.  Don't bother
	    with it.
	<dt>unacceptable
	<dd>The data is not acceptable as primary detections of the objects,
	    but may still be useful.
	<dt>acceptable
	<dd>The data is acceptable as primary detections of the objects.
      </dl>
  <dt>Status
  <dd>This attribute determines whether this object list is a part of the
      basic survey.
      Each OL is assigned one of the following status values:<p>
      <dl>
	<dt>undetermined
	<dd>Its status has not yet been determined.
	<dt>primary
	<dd>This OL is part of the basic survey.
	<dt>secondary
	<dd>This OL is not part of the basic survey.
      </dl>
  <dt>Auto-Targeted
  <dd>Has this OL been through the automatic portion of target selection yet
      (e.g., bright galaxy, red galaxy, and QSO target selection)?
      Only primary OL may be processed through the target selection.
  <dt>Manually-Targeted
  <dd>Has this OL been through the manual portion of target selection yet
      (e.g., serendipity and stars target selection)?
      Only OL which have been auto-targeted my be manually-targeted.
</dl>
Quality is actually divided into a number of quality attributes.  Two types of
quality can be assigned: the quality of the data reductions (were the
reductions performed correctly, regardless of the inherent quality of the
data); and the inherent quality of the data (e.g., was the seeing good enough,
does the sky background vary across the field, etc).  For example, one way to
measure the quality is to examine the matchup of objects in overlap regions.
Such matchups can be effected by, among many things, poor seeing or large
centroiding errors due to weak detections (poor data quality), or due to poor
initial astrometric calibrations caused by incorrect matchups with the primary
astrometric standards (poor reduction quality).  Further, the quality of the
data and reductions may be measured in different ways, and different stages in
the processing.  The following three stages of quality analysis are identified.
For each of these stages, a separate quality is assigned for bot the reduction
quality and the data quality.
<dl>
  <dt>Check-in
  <dd>An initial quality analysis will be performed when the output of the FPR
      is read into the Operational Databases by the Frames Pipeline
      Postprocessor.  This stage may use any data and diagnostic outputs of the
      Frames Pipeline, including the corrected images, atlas images, and any
      other output which is not stored directly in the Operational Databases,
      but are easily accessed at this point as they are still located wherever
      the Frames Pipeline left them.  Since merging of objects has not yet been
      done, this stage of quality analysis is internal to a given FPR only,
      with no use of comparisons with overlapping drift scans.
      to any 
  <dt>Merge and Final Calibrations
  <dd>Additional QA will be done after merging the objects in a given FPR and
      applying final calibrations to objects in a set of OLs.  This QA will
       specifically take advantage of the objects which match objects in other
       FPRs.  Note that there is no one particular time that a given OL can be
       considered "merged", as additional observations in the same or
       overlapping areas of the sky may introduce additional objects to be
       matched up.  Thus, it is yet to be determined exactly when this form of
       QA is considered done.  Perhaps the best time would be immediately
       before a given area of sky is considered for target selection.
  <dt> After target selection
  <dd> A great deal of QA will be performed by scientists playing with the
       data, particularly during target selection.
</dl>
<p>
For a primary OL, most objects in the OL within the portion of sky covered by
the associated scanline will then have their status set to primary, and most
objects in the OL outside the scanline will have their status set to
secondary.  We must also account for overlap between adjacent fields within a
given Drift Scan.  We do this by dividing the overlap regions in two in the
obvious way.  For a given OL, objects falling within the inner halves of the
two overlap regions are assigned the same status as the OL, while those objects
in the outer halves are assigned the status <em>secondary</em>.  These rules
have exceptions.  Those objects whose status is
already set to <em>DUPLICATE</em> will be left alone.  Some objects may have
already had there status set to secondary because an overlapping OL was
already set to be a primary OL.  This will mostly affect OLs from a
different Drift Scan of the same scanline which overlaps at the ends with
this one, and from border affects with adjacent scanlines.  These
details will be described later under operations.  One rule to which there is
no exception is that no objects belonging to a secondary OL may themselves be
primary.

<h2><a name="operations">Operations</a></h2>

There are 7 basic operations which bring the objects from the Frames
Pipeline through target selection, and which perform most of what is required
to define the imaging survey.  Each step is outlined here.

<h3><a name="postprocessor">Frames Pipeline Postprocessor</a></h3>

The <em>Frames Pipeline Postprocessor</em> stuffs into the
<em>Operational Database</em> the results of
a single FPR, making the appropriate bookkeeping links, and assigns an initial
data and reduction quality to each OL in the run.  Initial quality analysis
must be done at this stage, as we have easy access to all outputs of the
Frames Pipelines (including things like corrected frames which are not easily
accessed from the Operational Databases).

<h3><a name="merge">Merge Objects</a></h3>

A single execution of the <em>Merge Objects</em> task operates on all OL in a
single FPR.  Each object created by that FPR is merged with all other matching
objects in the database.  The matching algorithm is left undefined here.
An object may be matched only against other objects whose FPR has already
been through the <em>Merge Objects</em> task.
Note that two objects which match need not both match-up with the same set of
objects.  The simplest instance of this is when two objects which are
unblended in one FPR are blended as a single object in another FPR.
<p>
Each OL in the FPR is processed in order of increasing field number.  For
each OL, the algorithm in brief is as follows (<strong>WARNING: this
algortihm has not been thoroughly thought through, and most certainly is
wrong --- this is all very complicated</strong>):
<ol>
<li>A portion of the sky is assigned
to each OL, defined as the intersection of the field with the scanline which
it tracks, excluding the "outer" halves of the overlap regions at either end of
the field (these are assigned to the adjacent fields).  All objects whose
centers fall within this region of sky are assigned the status
<em>OK_FIELD</em>, while those objects falling outside this region of sky are
assigned the status <em>OUT_OF_RANGE</em>.
<li>The objects are then matched up with objects in the overlapping region of
previous OL in the same FPR.  Note that a given object may match more than one
object from the previous OL.  For each object with one or more matches, the
following algorithm is applied:
<ol>
<li>If its status is <em>OK_FIELD</em>: set the status of each matching object
to <em>DUPLICATE</em>.
<li>If its status is <em>OUT_OF_RANGE</em>: if any of its matching objects is
<em>OK_FIELD</em>, set this object's status to <em>DUPLICATE</em>; else set
all matching object's status to <em>DUPLICATE</em>.
</ol>
<li>The objects are then matched up with objects overlapping OLs in other FPRs.
For each object with one or more matches and whose status is not
<em>DUPLICATE</em>, the following algorithm is applied:
<ol>
<li>If its status is <em>OK_FIELD</em>: set the status of each matching object
to <em>DUPLICATE</em>.
<li>If its status is <em>OUT_OF_RANGE</em>: if any of its matching objects is
<em>OK_FIELD</em>, set this object's status to <em>DUPLICATE</em>; else set
all matching object's status to <em>DUPLICATE</em>.
</ol>
<p>
This task is an entirely automatic task, requiring no human decisions.
<p>
This task may be undone with no side-effects, so long as the task
<em>Select Primaries</em> has not been run on the FPR.

<h3><a name="finalCal">Final Calibration</a></h3>
TBD

<h3><a name="qa">Quality Analysis</a></h3>

A quality must be assigned to every OL by a human.  This task
operates on an arbitrary set of OLs.  All OLs must have been through the
<em>Merge Objects</em> task for a final quality to be assigned.
Not necessarily every OL in a given FPR
need be assigned a quality at the same time (i.e., within a given run of this
task).
<p>
If an OL is processed more than once through <em>Quality Analysis</em>,
its old quality is written over, with no history kept of any previous QA.
<p>
This task may be undone, so long as the task <em>Select Primaries</em> has not
yet been run on any of the OLs.  When undoing, the quality of all OLs touched
by this invocation will be set to <em>undetermined</em>.

<h3><a name="select">Select Primaries</a></h3>

The <em>Select Primaries</em> task operates on an arbitrary set of OL (each of
which must have a final quality assigned), assigning a survey status (primary
or secondary) to each OL and the objects contained within those OLs.  This task
proceeds in two stages.  First, a human must assign a status to each OL, within
the restrictions of the following guidelines:
<ul>
  <li>Any OL assigned primary status <strong>must</strong> have its
      quality set to <em>acceptable</em>.
  <li>One thinks of the assignment of status in terms of unbroken lengths of
      scanlines.  We are determining which objects will represent the AOs in
      that portion of sky.  For any such piece of a scanline, primary status
      should be assigned to a contiguous set of OL from the same FPR for the
      earliest Drift Scan which produced acceptable data.
  <li>There are few instances in which the previous guideline should be
      ignored.  One case where it may be ignored is when an earlier short Drift
      Scan is passed over in favor of a later but considerably longer Drift
      Scan including the same region.
  <li>No OL should be set as primary if one or more OL which were previously
      set as primary completely cover the same piece of scanline.  Such a
      case should be automatically detected.
</ul>
<p>
The second stage assigns a survey status to each object in the OLs, and
is performed automatically, with no human intervention.
The OL are ordered on the basis of the time at which the observations
were obtained, with the earliest obtained data first.  In other words,
they are ordered first by run number, low run number first,
with all OL for a given run ordered by field number, low field number first.
Each OL is then taken in order, and the objects in each OL looped over.
The algorithm varies depending on whether the OL is primary or secondary.
<dl>
  <dt>Primary OL
  <dd>The following algorithm is used:
      <ul>
	<li>If an object already has its status set to <em>DUPLICATE</em>, then
	    it is left as is.  If not, then continue to the next step.
	<li>Check the status of all matching objects.  If any are primary
	    objects, then set the status to <em>secondary</em>.  If none
	    are primary but one or more are secondary and belong to an OL
	    whose status is primary, then set the status to
	    <em>primary</em> (this takes care of confusing border objects
	    whose AO cannot be assigned to a unique scanline).  If neither,
	    then continue to the next step.
	<li>If the object lies within the associated scanline then set its
	    status to <em>primary</em>.  If not, set its status to
	    <em>secondary</em>.
      </ul>
  <dt>Secondary OL
  <dd>If an object already has its status set to <em>DUPLICATE</em>, then it is
      left as is.  If not, then set its status to <em>secondary</em>.
</dl>
<p>
This task may be undone only if there are no overlapping OL not processed
by this invocation which have been processed by a later invocation.

<h3><a name="auto">Automatic Target Selection</a></h3>

Automatic target selection operates on an arbitrary set of primary OL.  All
primary objects contained within those OL are passed to the target selection
pipeline.  Those objects selected as targets have their target attribute
set to <em>true</em>.
<p>
This task is an entirely automatic task, requiring no human decisions.
<p>
This task may be undone only if all OL processed by this invocation have not
yet been though manual target selection.

<h3><a name="auto">Manual Target Selection</a></h3>

Manual target selection operates on an arbitrary set of primary OL (all of
which must have been processed through <em>Automatic Target Selection</em>).
All primary objects contained within those OL are presented to the Survey
collaborators via the Science Archive Database for manual target selection.
Those objects selected as targets have their target attribute
set to <em>true</em>.
<p>
This task is an entirely human task.
<p>
This task may be undone only if all OL processed by this invocation have not
yet been though tiling.
