<H1>SDSS Data Model</H1>

The SDSS Data Model is <STRONG>THE</STRONG> definition of the retained data
in the survey, as well as all interface data between independent components of
the survey (e.g., between separate pipelines, or between pipelines and the
Operational Database).  All pipelines, as well as the Operational Databases,
must be in compliance with the Data Model.
 <P>
The SDSS Data Model uses the formal methodology of Rumbaugh's Object
Modeling Technique (<cite>Rumbaugh, J., Blaha, M.,
Premerlani, W., Eddy, F., and Lorensen, W. 1991,
Object-Oriented Modeling and Design, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs,
N.J.</cite>), as implemented
by the object-oriented CASE tool <EM>Paradigm Plus</EM> (hereafter PP).
The official
survey definition of all data is stored within Paradigm Plus.  Paradigm Plus
provides numerous views on this Data Model, as well as the ability to
automatically generate C++ code, FITS file formats, and other interfaces to
the survey retained data derived directly from the Data Model.
 <P>
The Data Model is essentially complete for the Monitor Telescope, the DA for
Imaging Array, the main imaging pipelines (ssc, astrom, ps, and frames),
and target selection.  The spectroscopic aspects of the survey are yet to be
incorporated, but are currently under development.
 <p>
This set of documentation describes our use of a formal Data Model to define
the survey retained data; how to use Paradigm Plus to interact with the
Data Model; and presents various views of the Data Model.

<h2><a href="../../flatFiles/FILES.html">Flat-File Formats</a></h2>

The primary view of the Data Model for the user are the flat-file formats.
These <STRONG>DEFINE</STRONG> the formats for <STRONG>ALL</STRONG> inputs and
outputs for all pipelines.  All inputs are in the form of flat-files, which are
found in two flavors: FITS files (both images and binary tables), and FTCL
parameter files (i.e., files readable with the DERVISH utility
<em>param2Chain</em>.  A complete list of all flat-file formats for the set of
pipelines and other survey components currently supported by the Data Model
may be found <a href="../../flatFiles/FILES.html">here</a>.
<p>
TCL procs are available to check the format of DA/pipeline output flatfiles
against the data model.  Their use is described <a href="check.html">here</a>.

<h2>For the Developer</h2>

The following sections are of interest to developers of the Data Model.
Development includes maintaining the abstract view of the Survey Data within
PP, as well as the two primary views of the data model: the flat-file formats;
and the C++ database schema definitions.
